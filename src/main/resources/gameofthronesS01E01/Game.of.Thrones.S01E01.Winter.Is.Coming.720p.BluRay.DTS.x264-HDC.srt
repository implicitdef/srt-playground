00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,958
their lives are too short.

168
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,215
[Thunder rumbles]

169
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:23,763
[Caws]

170
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,821
[Birds chirping]

171
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,707
All these years,

172
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,960
and I still feel like an outsider
when I come here.

173
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,464
You have five northern children.

174
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:01,009
You're not an outsider.

175
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:03,637
I wonder if the old gods agree.

176
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,765
It's your gods with all the rules.

177
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,857
I am so sorry, my love.

178
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,612
- Tell me.
- There was a raven from King's Landing.

179
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,282
Jon Arryn is dead.

180
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,910
A fever took him.

181
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,957
I know he was like a father to you.

182
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:38,129
- Your sister, the boy?
- They both have their health,

183
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,256
gods be good.

184
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:51,851
The raven brought more news.

185
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,356
The king rides for Winterfell...

186
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,193
with the queen and all the rest of them.

187
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,446
If he's coming this far north...

188
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,033
there's only one thing he's after.

189
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,537
You can always say no, Ned.

190
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:22,590
[Catelyn] We'll need plenty of candles
for Lord Tyrion's chamber.

191
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:26,469
- I'm told he reads all night.
- I'm told he drinks all night.

192
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,764
How much could he possibly drink?
A man of his...

193
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,433
stature?

194
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,436
We've brought up eight barrels of ale
from the cellar.

195
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:35,770
Perhaps we'll find out.

196
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,731
In any case, candles.

197
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,781
Why is your mother so dead set on us
getting pretty for the king?

198
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,659
It's for the queen, I bet.
I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.

199
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,828
I hear the prince is a right royal prick.

200
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:55,415
Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab
with his right royal prick.

201
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,461
Go on, Tommy, shear him good.

202
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,880
He's never met a girl he likes better
than his own hair.

203
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,715
[Laughter]

204

- [Pup yaps]
- Gods, but they grow fast.

Brandon!

206
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,635
I saw the king.
He's got hundreds of people.

207
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,846
How many times have I told you?
No climbing.

208
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:54,933
But he's coming right now, down our road.

209
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,359
I want you to promise me,

210
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,152
no more climbing.

211
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,158
I promise.

212
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:17,372
- Do you know what?
- What?

213
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:19,707
You always look at your feet
before you lie.

214
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,751
[Chuckles]

215
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,628
Run and find your father.

216
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,797
Tell him the king is close.

217
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,595
Where's Arya?
Sansa, where's your sister?

218
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:26,065
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Oh.

219
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,109
What are you doing with that on?

220
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,614
- Go on.

You've got fat.

- Cat!
- Your Grace.

227

Nine years... Why haven't I seen you?
Where the hell have you been?

228
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:30,732
Guarding the North for you, Your Grace.
Winterfell is yours.

229
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,196
- Where's the Imp?
- Will you shut up?

230
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,823
[Robert] Who have we here?

231
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,534
You must be Robb.

232
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,622
My, you're a pretty one.

233
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:49,917
Your name is?

234
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,419
Arya.

235
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:55,214
Oh, show us your muscles.

236
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,843
[Chuckles] You'll be a soldier.

237
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:04,140
[Arya] That's Jaime Lannister,
the queen's twin brother.

238
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,392
[Sansa] Would you please shut up?

239
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:19,822
My queen.

240
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,949
Take me to your crypt.
I want to pay my respects.

241
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:23,910
We've been riding for a month, my love.

242
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,037
Surely the dead can wait.

243
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,039
Ned.

244
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,925
Where's the Imp?

245
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,430
[Queen] Where is our brother?

246
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,307
Go and find the little beast.

247
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,353
Tell me about Jon Arryn.

248
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,815
One minute he was fine and then...

249
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:57,777
burned right through him,
whatever it was.

250
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,947
I loved that man.

251
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,407
We both did.

252
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:06,869
[Robert] He never had to teach you much,
but me? You remember me at 16?

253
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,830
- [Chuckles]
- All I wanted to do

254
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,582
was crack skulls and fuck girls.

255
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,836
- He showed me what was what.
- Aye.

256
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,588
Don't look at me like that.
It's not his fault I didn't listen.

257
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,549
[Both laugh]

[Sighs]

259
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,178
I need you, Ned,

260
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,974
down at King's Landing, not up here
where you're no damn use to anybody.

261
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:31,644
Lord Eddard Stark...

262
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,064
I would name you the Hand of the King.

263
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,654
I'm not worthy of the honor.

264
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,197
I'm not trying to honor you.

265
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,032
I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom

266
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:48,870
while I eat, drink and whore my way
to an early grave.

267
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:50,830
Damn it, Ned, stand up.

268
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,333
You helped me win the Iron Throne,

269
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,170
now help me keep the damn thing.

270
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,672
We were meant to rule together.

271
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,634
If your sister had lived,
we'd have been bound by blood.

272
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:06,179
Well, it's not too late.

273
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:09,515
I have a son,
you have a daughter.

274
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,019
We'll join our houses.

275
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,025
[Woman moaning]

00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,038
[Sighs]

277

[Cup falls]

278
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:41,172
It is true what they say
about the northern girls.

279
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:42,381
[Giggles]

280
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,724
Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?

281
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,476
I did hear something about that.

282
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,770
And the queen and her twin brother.

283
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:58,940
They say that he is the most handsome man
in the Seven Kingdoms.

284
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:00,942
And the other brother?

285
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:04,278
- The queen has two brothers?
- There's the pretty one...

286
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:07,198
and there's the clever one.

287
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:09,992
Mmm...

288
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,370
I hear they call him the Imp.

289
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,288
I hear he hates that nickname.

290
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:17,792
Oh? I hear he's more than earned it.

291
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:20,169
I hear he's a drunken little lecher,

292
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,755
prone to all manner of perversions.

293
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,674
Clever girl.

294
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,261
We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.

295
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,180
Have you?

296
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,682
- Already?
- Oh!

297
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,312
- The gods gave me one blessing.
- [Laughs]

298
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,480
[Door opens]

299
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,695
- Don't get up.
- My lord.

300
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:49,490
Should I explain to you the meaning of
a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?

301
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,659
You have much to teach me, no doubt,

302
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:54,954
but our sister craves your attention.

303
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,665
She has odd cravings, our sister.

304
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,834
A family trait.

305
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,420
Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown.

306
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:07,383
- Don't leave me alone with these people.
- I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early.

307
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:10,845
And this is the first of many courses.

308
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:13,180
I thought you might say that.

309
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:15,933
But since we're short on time...

310
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,351
Come on, girls.

311
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:20,104
[Giggling]

312
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:25,109
See you at sundown.

313
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,320
[Tyrion] Close the door!

314
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,501
Did you have to bury her
in a place like this?

315
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,589
She should be on a hill somewhere

316
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:49,050
with the sun and the clouds above her.

317
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:51,218
She was my sister.

318
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:53,012
This is where she belongs.

319
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:56,515
She belonged with me.

320
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,191
In my dreams,
I kill him every night.

321
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:11,030
It's done, Your Grace.
The Targaryens are gone.

322
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,160
Not all of them.

323
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:19,580
[Gull crying]

324
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:29,048
[Man] Daenerys!

325
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,928
Daenerys.

326
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:36,055
There's our bride-to-be.

327
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:39,642
Look, a gift from Illyrio.

328
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:42,812

00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:20,425
I think so, Your Grace.

493
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,677
And have you bled yet?

494
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:29,267
No, Your Grace.

495
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,396
Your dress, did you make it?

496
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:37,442
Such talent.
You must make something for me.

497
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:42,406
I hear we might share
a grandchild someday.

498
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,616
I hear the same.

499
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,952
Your daughter will do well in the capital.

500
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:50,414
Such a beauty shouldn't stay
hidden up here forever.

501
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:10,058
- Your pardon.
- I hear we might be neighbors soon.

502
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:13,645
- I hope it's true.
- Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.

503
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,982
I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate
your new title, if you accept.

504
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,192
It would be good
to have you on the field.

505
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,695
The competition has become a bit stale.

506
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:24,072
- I don't fight in tournaments.
- No?

507
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,740

[Chuckles]

I don't fight in tournaments

510
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:32,247
because when I fight a man for real,

511

I don't want him to know what I can do.

She always does this.

This was my favorite dress
and she ruined it.

She always does it
and it's not funny!

[Ned] I'm a Northman.

I belong here with you, not down south
in that rats' nest they call a capital.

522
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:17,167
I won't let him take you.

523
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:21,296
The king takes what he wants.

524
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,715
[Snorts] That's why he's king.

525

"He belongs to me now."

00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:40,690
How did he get so fat?

530
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:45,111
He only stops eating
when it's time for a drink. [Chuckles]

Pardon, my lord, my lady.

What's she doing at the Eyrie?

540
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:23,358
She hasn't been back there
since her wedding.

541
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:33,702
[Ned] What news?

542
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,789
[Catelyn] She's fled the capital.

543
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:42,669
She says Jon Arryn was murdered.

544
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,671
By the Lannisters.

545
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:47,465
She says the king is in danger.

546
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:49,843
She's fresh widowed, Cat.

547
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:51,595
She doesn't know what she's saying.

548
00:48:51,721 --> 00:48:57,017
Lysa's head would be on a spike right now
if the wrong people had found that letter.

549
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:59,311
Do you think she would risk her life,

550
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:01,021
her son's life,

551
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:04,524
if she wasn't certain
her husband was murdered?

552
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:13,617
If this news is true...

553
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:17,287
and the Lannisters conspire
against the throne,

554
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:19,831
who but you can protect the king?

555
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,208
They murdered the last Hand.

556
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:24,544
Now you want Ned to take the job?

557
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:28,548
The king rode for a month
to ask for Lord Stark's help.

558
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,176
He's the only one he trusts.

559
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:35,513
You swore the king an oath, my lord.

560
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,225
He's spent half his life
fighting Robert's wars.

561
00:49:39,352 --> 00:49:41,353
He owes him nothing.

562
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:46,483
Your father and brother
rode south once

563

on a king's demand.

564
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:53,281

When do I meet with the khal?
We need to begin planning the invasion.

570
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,978
If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown,
you shall have it.

00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:08,148
- When?
- When their omens favor war.
