1
00:01:55,685 --> 00:01:57,957
Easy, boy.

2
00:03:11,198 --> 00:03:13,367
<i>What do you expect?</i>
<i>They're savages.</i>

3
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,736
One lot steals a goat
from another lot,

4
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,773
before you know it they're
ripping each other to pieces.

5
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:20,975
I've never seen wildlings
do a thing like this.

6
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,311
I never seen a thing like
this, not ever in my life.

7
00:03:23,346 --> 00:03:26,215
How close did you get?

8
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:29,184
- Close as any man would.
- We should head back to the wall.

9
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:33,355
Do the dead frighten you?

10
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:35,824
Our orders were
to track the wildlings.

11
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:38,693
We tracked them.
They won't trouble us no more.

12
00:03:38,727 --> 00:03:41,396
You don't think
he'll ask us how they died?

13
00:03:43,332 --> 00:03:45,333
Get back on your horse.

14
00:03:50,305 --> 00:03:52,206
Whatever did it to them
could do it to us.

15
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:54,208
They even killed the children.

16
00:03:54,243 --> 00:03:57,312
It's a good thing
we're not children.

17
00:03:58,814 --> 00:04:01,416
You want to run away south,
run away.

18
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:04,353
Of course they will
behead you as a deserter,

19
00:04:04,387 --> 00:04:06,756
if I don't catch you first.

20
00:04:09,026 --> 00:04:11,294
Get back on your horse.

21
00:04:11,328 --> 00:04:13,296
I won't say it again.

22
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:47,396
Your dead men seem
to have moved camp.

23
00:04:47,431 --> 00:04:49,965
They were here.

24
00:04:53,237 --> 00:04:55,605
See where they went.

25
00:05:41,086 --> 00:05:43,254
What is it?

26
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:45,757
It's...

27
00:07:15,778 --> 00:07:25,980
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

28
00:09:48,197 --> 00:09:51,266
Go on, father's watching.

29
00:09:53,303 --> 00:09:55,204
<i>And your mother.</i>

30
00:10:01,212 --> 00:10:04,582
Fine work as always.
Well done.

31
00:10:04,616 --> 00:10:06,451
Thank you.

32
00:10:06,485 --> 00:10:10,454
I love the detail that you've
managed to get in these corners.

33
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:12,423
<i>Quite beautiful.</i>

34
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,491
The stitching...

35
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:38,318
And which one of you
was a marksman at 10?

36
00:10:39,287 --> 00:10:40,854
Keep practicing, Bran.

37
00:10:42,924 --> 00:10:44,958
Go on.

38
00:10:44,993 --> 00:10:47,861
Don't think too much, Bran.

39
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,397
Relax your bow arm.

40
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:06,010
Quick, Bran!
Faster.

41
00:11:07,513 --> 00:11:09,581
Lord Stark!

42
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:12,617
My lady.

43
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:15,820
A guardsman just
rode in from the hills.

44
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:18,856
They've captured a deserter
from the Night's Watch.

45
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,529
Get the lads to saddle
their horses.

46
00:11:24,563 --> 00:11:26,597
Do you have to?

47
00:11:26,631 --> 00:11:28,965
He swore an oath, Cat.

48
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,967
The law is law, my lady.

49
00:11:32,136 --> 00:11:33,970
Tell Bran he's coming too.

50
00:11:35,772 --> 00:11:37,439
Ned.

51
00:11:37,474 --> 00:11:39,808
10 is too young
to see such things.

52
00:11:39,842 --> 00:11:41,609
He won't be a boy forever.

53
00:11:43,512 --> 00:11:45,846
And winter is coming.

54
00:12:04,235 --> 00:12:07,837
Lad, go run back
and get the rest.

55
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,277
White walkers.

56
00:12:14,311 --> 00:12:17,046
I saw the white walkers.

57
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:19,015
White walkers.

58
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:22,117
The white walkers, I saw them.

59
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,795
I know I broke my oath.

60
00:12:34,064 --> 00:12:35,898
And I know I'm a deserter.

61
00:12:35,932 --> 00:12:39,635
I should have gone back to the
wall and warned them, but...

62
00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:41,837
I saw what I saw.

63
00:12:41,872 --> 00:12:43,872
I saw the white walkers.

64
00:12:45,675 --> 00:12:47,610
<i>People need to know.</i>

65
00:12:49,746 --> 00:12:51,614
If you can get word
to my family...

66
00:12:51,648 --> 00:12:54,050
<i>Tell them I'm no coward.</i>

67
00:12:54,084 --> 00:12:56,219
<i>Tell them I'm sorry.</i>

68
00:13:13,036 --> 00:13:14,804
Forgive me, lord.

69
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:21,510
In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

70
00:13:21,544 --> 00:13:23,445
- the first of his name...
- Don't look away.

71
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:26,348
- <i>...King of the Andals and the First Men...</i>
- Father will know if you do.

72
00:13:26,383 --> 00:13:29,918
<i>...Lord of the Seven Kingdoms</i>
<i>and protector of the realm,</i>

73
00:13:29,953 --> 00:13:32,688
I, Eddard of the House Stark,

74
00:13:32,723 --> 00:13:35,592
Lord of Winterfell
and warden of the north,

75
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:38,161
sentence you to die.

76
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,077
You did well.

77
00:14:22,272 --> 00:14:24,206
You understand why I did it?

78
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,208
Jon said he was a deserter.

79
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:28,910
But do you understand
why <i>I</i> had to kill him?

80
00:14:28,945 --> 00:14:30,712
"Our way is the old way"?

81
00:14:32,314 --> 00:14:34,282
The man who passes the sentence

82
00:14:34,316 --> 00:14:36,050
should swing the sword.

83
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:39,454
Is it true he saw
the white walkers?

84
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,326
The white walkers have been
gone for thousands of years.

85
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,163
So he was lying?

86
00:14:51,102 --> 00:14:53,904
A madman sees what he sees.

87
00:15:19,664 --> 00:15:21,832
What is it?

88
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:26,270
Mountain lion?

89
00:15:27,572 --> 00:15:29,574
There are no mountain lions
in these woods.

90
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,559
It's a freak!

91
00:16:18,461 --> 00:16:21,196
It's a direwolf.

92
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:31,773
Tough old beast.

93
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:35,977
There are no direwolves
south of the wall.

94
00:16:36,011 --> 00:16:38,145
Now there are five.

95
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,848
You want to hold it?

96
00:16:45,053 --> 00:16:47,554
Where will they go?

97
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,390
Their mother's dead.

98
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:51,059
They don't belong down here.

99
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,027
Better a quick death.

100
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:54,929
They won't last
without their mother.

101
00:16:54,963 --> 00:16:57,131
- Right. Give it here.
- No!

102
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,899
Put away your blade.

103
00:16:58,933 --> 00:17:01,068
I take orders from
your father, not you.

104
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,904
- Please, father!
- I'm sorry, Bran.

105
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,807
Lord Stark?

106
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:08,309
There are five pups...

107
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,645
One for each
of the Stark children.

108
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,482
The direwolf is the sigil of your house.

109
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:18,052
They were meant to have them.

110
00:17:22,991 --> 00:17:25,426
You will train them yourselves.

111
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,428
You will feed them yourselves.

112
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:30,498
And if they die, you will
bury them yourselves.

113
00:17:38,706 --> 00:17:40,841
What about you?

114
00:17:41,743 --> 00:17:43,344
I'm not a Stark.

115
00:17:43,378 --> 00:17:45,579
Get on.

116
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,058
What is it?

117
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:04,832
The runt of the litter...
That one's yours, Snow.

118
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,126
As your brother, I feel
it's my duty to warn you:

119
00:19:09,395 --> 00:19:11,429
you worry too much.

120
00:19:11,464 --> 00:19:14,799
- It's starting to show.
- And you never worry about anything.

121
00:19:16,502 --> 00:19:20,072
<i>When we were seven and you jumped
off the cliffs at Casterly Rock,</i>

122
00:19:20,106 --> 00:19:22,441
100-foot drop into the water,

123
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:24,543
and you were never afraid.

124
00:19:24,578 --> 00:19:27,279
There was nothing to be afraid
of until you told father.

125
00:19:27,313 --> 00:19:29,180
"We're Lannisters.

126
00:19:29,214 --> 00:19:31,682
Lannisters don't act like fools."

127
00:19:33,352 --> 00:19:35,619
<i>What if Jon Arryn told someone?</i>

128
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:37,954
But who would he tell?

129
00:19:37,989 --> 00:19:41,124
- My husband.
- If he told the king, both our heads

130
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:43,359
would be skewered
on the city gates by now.

131
00:19:44,895 --> 00:19:47,898
Whatever Jon Arryn knew or
didn't know, it died with him.

132
00:19:47,932 --> 00:19:51,735
And Robert will choose a new Hand
of the King... someone to do his job

133
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:54,671
while he's off fucking boars
and hunting whores...

134
00:19:54,706 --> 00:19:57,674
Or is it the other way around?

135
00:19:57,709 --> 00:20:00,110
And life will go on.

136
00:20:00,144 --> 00:20:02,713
You should be
the Hand of the King.

137
00:20:02,747 --> 00:20:05,582
That's an honor
I can do without.

138
00:20:05,617 --> 00:20:07,751
Their days are too long,

139
00:20:07,785 --> 00:20:10,053
their lives are too short.

140
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,027
All these years

141
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:51,729
and I still feel like an outsider

142
00:20:51,763 --> 00:20:53,998
when I come here.

143
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:56,568
You have five northern children.

144
00:20:56,602 --> 00:20:59,837
You're not an outsider.

145
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:02,807
I wonder if the old gods agree.

146
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:06,811
It's your gods with all the rules.

147
00:21:11,952 --> 00:21:14,887
I am so sorry, my love.

148
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:19,826
- Tell me.
- There was a raven from King's Landing.

149
00:21:21,696 --> 00:21:23,397
Jon Arryn is dead.

150
00:21:23,431 --> 00:21:26,100
<i>A fever took him.</i>

151
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,172
<i>I know he was like</i>
<i>a father to you.</i>

152
00:21:33,975 --> 00:21:37,244
- <i>Your sister, the boy?</i>
- They both have their health,

153
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:39,446
<i>gods be good.</i>

154
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:52,092
The raven brought more news...

155
00:21:53,328 --> 00:21:55,429
The king rides
for Winterfell...

156
00:21:55,464 --> 00:21:57,164
With the queen

157
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:59,333
<i>and all the rest of them.</i>

158
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:02,637
If he's coming
this far north...

159
00:22:04,007 --> 00:22:06,208
There's only one thing he's after.

160
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:09,278
You can always say no, Ned.

161
00:22:17,988 --> 00:22:21,725
We'll need plenty of
candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber.

162
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:23,693
I'm told he reads all night.

163
00:22:23,728 --> 00:22:25,629
I'm told he drinks all night.

164
00:22:25,663 --> 00:22:28,966
How much could he possibly drink?
A man of his...

165
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,767
Stature?

166
00:22:30,802 --> 00:22:33,471
We've brought up eight barrels
of ale from the cellar.

167
00:22:33,505 --> 00:22:36,040
- Perhaps we'll find out.
- In any case,

168
00:22:36,074 --> 00:22:38,743
<i>candles.</i>

169
00:22:42,849 --> 00:22:45,918
Why is your mother so dead set on
us getting pretty for the king?

170
00:22:45,952 --> 00:22:48,787
It's for the queen, I bet.
I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.

171
00:22:48,822 --> 00:22:50,923
I hear the prince
is a right royal prick.

172
00:22:50,957 --> 00:22:52,991
Think of all those southern
girls he gets to stab

173
00:22:53,026 --> 00:22:54,593
with his right royal prick.

174
00:22:56,361 --> 00:22:58,496
Go on, Tommy, shear him good.

175
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,999
He's never met a girl he likes
better than his own hair.

176
00:23:37,904 --> 00:23:40,772
Gods, but they grow fast.

177
00:23:43,142 --> 00:23:44,609
Brandon!

178
00:23:44,643 --> 00:23:47,979
I saw the king.
He's got hundreds of people.

179
00:23:48,013 --> 00:23:51,216
How many times have I
told you no climbing?

180
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,118
But he's coming right
now... down our road.

181
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:03,527
I want you to promise me,

182
00:24:03,562 --> 00:24:05,329
no more climbing.

183
00:24:09,734 --> 00:24:11,335
I promise.

184
00:24:13,605 --> 00:24:16,575
- Do you know what?
- What?

185
00:24:16,609 --> 00:24:18,910
You always look
at your feet before you lie.

186
00:24:21,581 --> 00:24:24,950
Run and find your father.
Tell him the king is close.

187
00:25:09,063 --> 00:25:12,766
Where's Arya?
Sansa, where's your sister?

188
00:25:22,878 --> 00:25:24,512
- Hey hey hey hey.
- Ohh.

189
00:25:24,546 --> 00:25:26,847
What are you doing
with that on?

190
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,786
Go on.

191
00:25:33,088 --> 00:25:34,889
Move!

192
00:26:56,903 --> 00:26:58,904
Your Grace.

193
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:05,011
You've got fat.

194
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,725
- Cat!
- Your Grace.

195
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:25,997
Nine years... Why haven't I seen you?
Where the hell have you been?

196
00:27:26,031 --> 00:27:27,932
Guarding the north
for you, Your Grace.

197
00:27:27,967 --> 00:27:30,736
<i>Winterfell is yours.</i>

198
00:27:33,773 --> 00:27:36,209
- Where's the Imp?
- Will you shut up?

199
00:27:36,243 --> 00:27:38,945
Who have we here?

200
00:27:38,979 --> 00:27:40,747
You must be Robb.

201
00:27:43,418 --> 00:27:47,054
My, you're a pretty one.

202
00:27:47,089 --> 00:27:49,056
Your name is?

203
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:51,658
Arya.

204
00:27:51,693 --> 00:27:54,729
Oh, show us your muscles.

205
00:27:56,498 --> 00:27:57,999
You'll be a soldier.

206
00:28:00,603 --> 00:28:03,405
<i>That's Jaime Lannister,</i>
<i>the queen's twin brother.</i>

207
00:28:03,439 --> 00:28:05,641
<i>Would you please shut up?</i>

208
00:28:15,084 --> 00:28:17,285
My queen.

209
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,954
My queen.

210
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:21,190
Take me to your crypt.
I want to pay my respects.

211
00:28:21,224 --> 00:28:23,459
We've been riding
for a month, my love.

212
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,194
Surely the dead can wait.

213
00:28:25,229 --> 00:28:27,196
Ned.

214
00:28:36,372 --> 00:28:38,173
Where's the Imp?

215
00:28:41,543 --> 00:28:43,577
Where is our brother?

216
00:28:43,611 --> 00:28:45,812
Go and find the little beast.

217
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:50,350
Tell me about Jon Arryn.

218
00:28:50,384 --> 00:28:53,019
One minute he was fine and then...

219
00:28:54,255 --> 00:28:56,990
Burned right through him,
whatever it was.

220
00:28:58,192 --> 00:29:00,127
I loved that man.

221
00:29:00,161 --> 00:29:01,495
We both did.

222
00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:04,765
He never had to
teach you much, but me?

223
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,033
You remember me at 16?

224
00:29:06,067 --> 00:29:08,002
All I wanted to do

225
00:29:08,036 --> 00:29:10,671
was crack skulls and fuck girls.

226
00:29:10,705 --> 00:29:13,607
- He showed me what was what.
- Aye.

227
00:29:13,641 --> 00:29:16,977
Don't look at me like that.
It's not his fault I didn't listen.

228
00:29:20,916 --> 00:29:23,250
I need you, Ned...

229
00:29:23,285 --> 00:29:27,188
down at King's Landing, not up here
where you're no damn use to anybody.

230
00:29:28,724 --> 00:29:31,592
Lord Eddard Stark,

231
00:29:31,627 --> 00:29:34,228
I would name you
the Hand of the King.

232
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:40,735
I'm not worthy of the honor.

233
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:44,506
I'm not trying to honor you.
I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom

234
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:48,076
while I eat, drink and whore
my way to an early grave.

235
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,211
Damn it, Ned, stand up.

236
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,649
You helped me win
the Iron Throne,

237
00:29:53,683 --> 00:29:55,784
now help me
keep the damn thing.

238
00:29:56,819 --> 00:29:58,820
We were meant to rule together.

239
00:29:58,854 --> 00:30:02,923
If your sister had lived,
we'd have been bound by blood.

240
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:05,326
Well, it's not too late.

241
00:30:06,728 --> 00:30:08,663
I have a son,
you have a daughter.

242
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,233
We'll join our houses.

243
00:30:36,227 --> 00:30:40,197
It is true what they say
about the northern girls.

244
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,674
Did you hear the king's
in Winterfell?

245
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:52,643
I did hear something about that.

246
00:30:52,677 --> 00:30:54,944
And the queen
and her twin brother.

247
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:58,114
They say that <i>he</i> is the most
handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.

248
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:00,282
And the other brother?

249
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:03,352
- The queen has two brothers?
- There's the pretty one,

250
00:31:03,386 --> 00:31:06,388
and there's the clever one.

251
00:31:08,257 --> 00:31:11,293
Mmm, I hear they
call him the Imp.

252
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,395
I hear he hates that nickname.

253
00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:16,665
Oh? I hear he's more
than earned it.

254
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,468
I hear he's a drunken
little lecher,

255
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,938
prone to all manner
of perversions.

256
00:31:21,972 --> 00:31:23,873
Clever girl.

257
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,510
We've been expecting you,
Lord Tyrion.

258
00:31:28,812 --> 00:31:30,713
Have you?

259
00:31:30,747 --> 00:31:32,615
- Oh!
- Already?

260
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:37,487
The gods gave me one blessing.

261
00:31:42,292 --> 00:31:44,894
- Don't get up.
- My lord.

262
00:31:44,928 --> 00:31:47,263
Should I explain to you
the meaning of a closed door

263
00:31:47,297 --> 00:31:51,034
- in a whorehouse, brother?
- You have much to teach me, no doubt,

264
00:31:51,068 --> 00:31:54,704
but our sister craves
your attention.

265
00:31:54,738 --> 00:31:56,840
She has odd cravings,
our sister.

266
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:59,008
A family trait.

267
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:01,911
Now the Starks are
feasting us at sundown.

268
00:32:01,946 --> 00:32:04,147
Don't leave me alone
with these people.

269
00:32:04,182 --> 00:32:06,550
<i>I'm sorry, I've begun</i>
<i>the feast a bit early.</i>

270
00:32:06,584 --> 00:32:09,953
And this is the first
of many courses.

271
00:32:09,987 --> 00:32:12,189
I thought you might say that.

272
00:32:12,223 --> 00:32:14,624
But since we're short on time...

273
00:32:14,658 --> 00:32:16,559
Come on, girls.

274
00:32:21,631 --> 00:32:23,933
See you at sundown.

275
00:32:23,967 --> 00:32:26,535
<i>Close the door!</i>

276
00:32:38,683 --> 00:32:41,685
Did you have to bury her
in a place like this?

277
00:32:43,422 --> 00:32:45,723
<i>She should be</i>
<i>on a hill somewhere</i>

278
00:32:45,758 --> 00:32:48,360
with the sun
and the clouds above her.

279
00:32:48,394 --> 00:32:50,362
<i>She was my sister.</i>

280
00:32:50,396 --> 00:32:53,164
This is where she belongs.

281
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:55,734
She belonged with me.

282
00:33:01,107 --> 00:33:04,376
In my dreams,
I kill him every night.

283
00:33:05,911 --> 00:33:08,379
It's done, Your Grace.

284
00:33:08,414 --> 00:33:11,049
The Targaryens are gone.

285
00:33:13,052 --> 00:33:15,353
Not all of them.

286
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:28,232
<i>Daenerys!</i>

287
00:33:31,303 --> 00:33:33,170
Daenerys.

288
00:33:33,205 --> 00:33:35,239
There's our bride-to-be.

289
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:39,276
Look, a gift from Illyrio.

290
00:33:40,345 --> 00:33:42,112
Touch it.

291
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:44,348
Go on, feel the fabric.

292
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:51,154
Mmm.

293
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:55,125
Isn't he a gracious host?

294
00:33:57,295 --> 00:33:59,330
We've been his guests
for over a year

295
00:33:59,364 --> 00:34:01,332
and he's never
asked us for anything.

296
00:34:01,366 --> 00:34:03,101
Illyrio's no fool.

297
00:34:03,135 --> 00:34:05,470
He knows I won't
forget my friends

298
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:07,539
when I come into my throne.

299
00:34:11,676 --> 00:34:14,344
You still slouch.

300
00:34:17,982 --> 00:34:20,383
Let them see.

301
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,921
You have a woman's body now.

302
00:34:43,472 --> 00:34:46,441
I need you to be perfect today.

303
00:34:47,843 --> 00:34:49,744
Can you do that for me?

304
00:34:53,149 --> 00:34:55,851
You don't want to wake
the dragon, do you?

305
00:34:57,288 --> 00:34:58,888
No.

306
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:08,899
When they write the history
of my reign, sweet sister,

307
00:35:08,933 --> 00:35:11,167
they will say it began today.

308
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,559
It's too hot, my lady.

309
00:35:57,246 --> 00:35:59,548
Where is he?

310
00:35:59,582 --> 00:36:02,216
The Dothraki are not known
for their punctuality.

311
00:36:15,431 --> 00:36:19,602
Athchomar chomakaan, Khal vezhven.

312
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:21,571
May I present
my honored guests?

313
00:36:21,605 --> 00:36:25,309
<i>Viserys of House Targaryen,</i>

314
00:36:25,343 --> 00:36:27,044
<i>the third of his name,</i>

315
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:30,414
<i>the rightful King of the Andals</i>
<i>and the First Men,</i>

316
00:36:30,448 --> 00:36:32,182
<i>and his sister</i>

317
00:36:32,217 --> 00:36:34,852
<i>Daenerys of House Targaryen.</i>

318
00:36:37,756 --> 00:36:40,224
Do you see
how long his hair is?

319
00:36:40,259 --> 00:36:42,960
<i>When Dothraki are</i>
<i>defeated in combat,</i>

320
00:36:42,994 --> 00:36:46,930
<i>they cut off their braids so the whole
world can see their shame.</i>

321
00:36:46,964 --> 00:36:50,933
Khal Drogo has
never been defeated.

322
00:36:52,135 --> 00:36:53,936
He's a savage, of course,

323
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:56,305
<i>but one of the finest killers alive.</i>

324
00:36:57,574 --> 00:36:59,708
And you will be his queen.

325
00:36:59,742 --> 00:37:02,377
Come forward, my dear.

326
00:37:42,451 --> 00:37:44,119
Where is he going?!

327
00:37:44,153 --> 00:37:46,688
- The ceremony is over.
- But he didn't say anything.

328
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:49,157
- Did he like her?
- Trust me, Your Grace,

329
00:37:49,192 --> 00:37:51,693
if he didn't like her,
we'd know.

330
00:37:54,697 --> 00:37:56,965
It won't be long now.

331
00:37:56,999 --> 00:37:58,900
Soon you will cross
the Narrow Sea

332
00:37:58,934 --> 00:38:01,369
and take back your father's throne.

333
00:38:01,403 --> 00:38:04,304
The people drink secret toasts

334
00:38:04,339 --> 00:38:06,039
to your health.

335
00:38:06,073 --> 00:38:08,408
They cry out
for their true king.

336
00:38:12,013 --> 00:38:13,881
When will they be married?

337
00:38:13,915 --> 00:38:17,452
Soon. The Dothraki never
stay still for long.

338
00:38:17,486 --> 00:38:20,021
Is it true they lie
with their horses?

339
00:38:20,056 --> 00:38:23,125
I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.

340
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,027
Do you take me for a fool?

341
00:38:25,061 --> 00:38:26,896
I take you for a king.

342
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:30,133
Kings lack the caution
of common men.

343
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:32,535
My apologies if
I've given offense.

344
00:38:32,569 --> 00:38:34,938
I know how to play
a man like Drogo.

345
00:38:34,972 --> 00:38:37,874
I give him a queen
and he gives me an army.

346
00:38:37,909 --> 00:38:40,778
I don't want to be his queen.

347
00:38:45,151 --> 00:38:47,253
I want to go home.

348
00:38:48,154 --> 00:38:49,621
So do I.

349
00:38:49,656 --> 00:38:52,791
I want us both to go home,

350
00:38:52,826 --> 00:38:55,126
but they took it from us.

351
00:38:55,161 --> 00:38:56,928
So tell me, sweet sister,

352
00:38:56,963 --> 00:38:59,164
how do we go home?

353
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,567
I don't know.

354
00:39:02,602 --> 00:39:05,604
We go home with an army.

355
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,442
With Khal Drogo's army.

356
00:39:10,477 --> 00:39:13,479
I would let his whole tribe fuck you...

357
00:39:13,513 --> 00:39:16,716
All 40,000 men
and their horses too

358
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,618
if that's what it took.

359
00:39:35,734 --> 00:39:38,169
Do you think Joffrey will like me?

360
00:39:38,203 --> 00:39:40,738
What if he thinks I'm ugly?

361
00:39:40,773 --> 00:39:44,443
Then he is the stupidest
prince that ever lived.

362
00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:49,347
He's so handsome.

363
00:39:49,382 --> 00:39:52,083
When would we be married?
Soon? Or do we have to wait?

364
00:39:52,118 --> 00:39:55,220
Hush now.
Your father hasn't even said yes.

365
00:39:55,254 --> 00:39:57,088
Why would he say no?

366
00:39:57,123 --> 00:40:00,392
He'd be the second most
powerful man in the kingdoms.

367
00:40:00,426 --> 00:40:02,994
He'd have to leave home.

368
00:40:03,029 --> 00:40:05,964
He'd have to leave me.

369
00:40:05,998 --> 00:40:09,001
And so would you.

370
00:40:09,035 --> 00:40:11,636
You left your home
to come here.

371
00:40:11,671 --> 00:40:14,472
And I'd be queen someday.

372
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:17,109
Please make father say yes!

373
00:40:17,143 --> 00:40:19,010
- Sansa...
- Please please!

374
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:21,980
It's the only thing
I ever wanted.

375
00:40:35,695 --> 00:40:37,963
Fill that up!
Boys, Rodrik, come on.

376
00:40:37,997 --> 00:40:40,265
<i>Come on!</i>

377
00:40:58,751 --> 00:41:01,519
Is he dead yet?

378
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:07,759
Uncle Benjen.

379
00:41:09,596 --> 00:41:12,064
You got bigger.

380
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:16,002
Rode all day. Didn't want to leave
you alone with the Lannisters.

381
00:41:16,036 --> 00:41:17,971
Why aren't you at the feast?

382
00:41:18,006 --> 00:41:21,041
Lady Stark thought it might
insult the royal family

383
00:41:21,076 --> 00:41:23,277
to seat a bastard
in their midst.

384
00:41:23,312 --> 00:41:26,014
Well, you're always
welcome on the wall.

385
00:41:26,048 --> 00:41:28,249
No bastard was ever
refused a seat there.

386
00:41:28,284 --> 00:41:29,984
So take me with you
when you go back.

387
00:41:30,019 --> 00:41:32,887
- Jon...
- Father will let me if you ask him.

388
00:41:32,921 --> 00:41:35,122
I know he will.

389
00:41:37,592 --> 00:41:39,826
The wall isn't going anywhere.

390
00:41:39,861 --> 00:41:41,194
I'm ready

391
00:41:41,228 --> 00:41:42,562
to swear your oath.

392
00:41:42,596 --> 00:41:45,298
You don't understand
what you'd be giving up.

393
00:41:45,332 --> 00:41:47,800
We have no families.

394
00:41:47,834 --> 00:41:51,171
- None of us will ever father sons...
- I don't care about that!

395
00:41:52,373 --> 00:41:54,841
You might, if you knew
what it meant.

396
00:41:58,146 --> 00:42:00,381
I'd better get inside,

397
00:42:00,415 --> 00:42:03,084
rescue your father
from his guests.

398
00:42:06,055 --> 00:42:08,123
We'll talk later.

399
00:42:15,964 --> 00:42:18,765
<i>Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.</i>

400
00:42:21,736 --> 00:42:24,070
What are you doing back there?

401
00:42:24,105 --> 00:42:27,273
Preparing for a night
with your family.

402
00:42:31,745 --> 00:42:33,846
I've always wanted
to see the wall.

403
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,615
You're Tyrion Lannister,

404
00:42:35,649 --> 00:42:37,250
the queen's brother?

405
00:42:37,284 --> 00:42:39,485
My greatest accomplishment.

406
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,289
And you... you're Ned Stark's
bastard, aren't you?

407
00:42:46,693 --> 00:42:48,928
Did I offend you?
Sorry.

408
00:42:50,897 --> 00:42:53,499
You are the bastard though.

409
00:42:54,734 --> 00:42:57,136
<i>Lord Eddard Stark is my father.</i>

410
00:42:58,505 --> 00:43:01,006
And Lady Stark
is not your mother,

411
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,308
making you the bastard.

412
00:43:05,511 --> 00:43:08,313
Let me give you
some advice, bastard.

413
00:43:09,481 --> 00:43:11,282
Never forget what you are.

414
00:43:11,317 --> 00:43:13,251
The rest of the world will not.

415
00:43:13,285 --> 00:43:15,854
Wear it like armor

416
00:43:15,889 --> 00:43:18,424
and it can never
be used to hurt you.

417
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:23,063
What the hell do you know
about being a bastard?

418
00:43:24,365 --> 00:43:27,768
All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes.

419
00:43:49,258 --> 00:43:53,628
You at a feast...
It's like a bear in a trap.

420
00:43:55,464 --> 00:43:57,798
The boy I beheaded...

421
00:43:57,833 --> 00:44:00,401
- Did you know him?
- Of course I did.

422
00:44:00,435 --> 00:44:02,537
Just a lad.

423
00:44:02,571 --> 00:44:04,305
And he was tough, Ned,

424
00:44:04,339 --> 00:44:06,107
a true ranger.

425
00:44:06,141 --> 00:44:09,611
Pfft.
He was talking madness.

426
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:13,015
Said the walkers
slaughtered his friends.

427
00:44:13,049 --> 00:44:15,617
The two he was with
are still missing.

428
00:44:17,286 --> 00:44:20,455
Hmph.
A wildling ambush.

429
00:44:20,489 --> 00:44:22,123
Maybe.

430
00:44:22,157 --> 00:44:25,693
Direwolves south of the wall,

431
00:44:25,728 --> 00:44:28,229
talk of the walkers,

432
00:44:28,263 --> 00:44:30,865
and my brother might be
the next Hand of the King.

433
00:44:30,899 --> 00:44:34,168
Winter <i>is</i> coming.

434
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:37,571
Winter is coming.

435
00:44:39,107 --> 00:44:42,042
- Uncle Benjen.
- Robb boy.

436
00:44:42,076 --> 00:44:43,677
- How are you?
- I'm good.

437
00:44:47,382 --> 00:44:49,616
Is this your first time
in the north, Your Grace?

438
00:44:49,651 --> 00:44:52,787
Yes.
Lovely country.

439
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:59,895
I'm sure it's very grim
after King's Landing.

440
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:03,266
I remember how scared I was
when Ned brought me

441
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,535
up here for the first time.

442
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:09,405
Hello, little dove.

443
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:12,775
But you are a beauty.

444
00:45:12,809 --> 00:45:14,910
- How old are you?
- 13, Your Grace.

445
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:17,679
You're tall.
Still growing?

446
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:19,614
I think so, Your Grace.

447
00:45:19,649 --> 00:45:21,883
And have you bled yet?

448
00:45:26,755 --> 00:45:28,455
No, Your Grace.

449
00:45:29,825 --> 00:45:31,993
Your dress, did you make it?

450
00:45:33,295 --> 00:45:36,631
Such a talent.
You must make something for me.

451
00:45:38,401 --> 00:45:41,503
I hear we might share
a grandchild someday.

452
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,773
I hear the same.

453
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,875
Your daughter will
do well in the Capital.

454
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:49,613
Such a beauty shouldn't stay
hidden up here forever.

455
00:46:05,697 --> 00:46:09,000
- Your pardon.
- I hear we might be neighbors soon.

456
00:46:09,034 --> 00:46:10,701
- I hope it's true.
- Yes,

457
00:46:10,736 --> 00:46:12,603
the king has honored me
with his offer.

458
00:46:12,637 --> 00:46:14,138
I'm sure we'll have
a tournament

459
00:46:14,173 --> 00:46:16,140
to celebrate your new
title... if you accept.

460
00:46:16,175 --> 00:46:18,377
It would be good
to have you on the field.

461
00:46:18,411 --> 00:46:20,579
The competition
has become a bit stale.

462
00:46:20,613 --> 00:46:23,349
- I don't fight in tournaments.
- No?

463
00:46:23,383 --> 00:46:24,884
Getting a little old for it?

464
00:46:24,918 --> 00:46:28,555
I don't fight in tournaments

465
00:46:28,589 --> 00:46:31,090
because when I fight
a man for real

466
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:33,359
I don't want him to know
what I can do.

467
00:46:35,195 --> 00:46:36,995
Well said.

468
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:40,965
Arya!

469
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:43,601
It's not funny!

470
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:46,370
<i>She always does this.</i>

471
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:48,272
<i>This was my favorite dress.</i>

472
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:51,575
She always does it
and it's not funny!

473
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,544
Time for bed.

474
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:07,560
I'm a Northman.

475
00:47:07,594 --> 00:47:09,996
I belong here with you,
not down south

476
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:12,532
in that rats' nest they call a Capital.

477
00:47:13,567 --> 00:47:16,301
I <i>won't</i> let him take you.

478
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:20,238
The king takes what he wants.

479
00:47:20,272 --> 00:47:22,840
That's why he's king.

480
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:27,744
I'll say,
"Listen, fat man."

481
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:31,648
"You are not taking
my husband anywhere.

482
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,084
He belongs to me now."

483
00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:39,790
How did he get so fat?

484
00:47:39,824 --> 00:47:42,659
He only stops eating when
it's time for a drink.

485
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,298
<i>It's Maester Luwin, my lord.</i>

486
00:47:49,801 --> 00:47:52,203
Send him in.

487
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:56,207
Pardon, my lord, my lady.

488
00:47:56,242 --> 00:47:59,077
A rider in the night...

489
00:47:59,111 --> 00:48:01,213
From your sister.

490
00:48:08,888 --> 00:48:11,557
- Stay.
- This was sent from the Eyrie.

491
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:19,798
What's she doing at the Eyrie?

492
00:48:19,832 --> 00:48:22,467
She hasn't been back there
since her wedding.

493
00:48:30,977 --> 00:48:32,945
What news?

494
00:48:34,281 --> 00:48:37,050
<i>She's fled the Capital.</i>

495
00:48:39,186 --> 00:48:41,855
She says Jon Arryn was murdered.

496
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:43,858
By the Lannisters.

497
00:48:43,892 --> 00:48:46,661
She says the king is in danger.

498
00:48:46,695 --> 00:48:48,964
She's fresh widowed, Cat.

499
00:48:48,998 --> 00:48:50,999
She doesn't know what she's saying.

500
00:48:51,033 --> 00:48:53,535
Lysa's head would be
on a spike right now

501
00:48:53,569 --> 00:48:55,737
if the wrong people
had found that letter.

502
00:48:55,771 --> 00:48:58,473
Do you think she would risk her life...

503
00:48:58,507 --> 00:49:00,141
her son's life...

504
00:49:00,175 --> 00:49:03,645
if she wasn't certain
her husband was murdered?

505
00:49:10,788 --> 00:49:12,688
If this news is true

506
00:49:12,722 --> 00:49:15,725
and the Lannisters conspire
against the Throne,

507
00:49:15,759 --> 00:49:19,061
who but you can
protect the king?

508
00:49:19,096 --> 00:49:21,297
They murdered the last Hand.

509
00:49:21,331 --> 00:49:23,700
Now you want Ned
to take the job?

510
00:49:23,734 --> 00:49:25,568
The king rode for a month

511
00:49:25,603 --> 00:49:27,637
to ask for Lord Stark's help.

512
00:49:27,671 --> 00:49:30,306
He's the only one he trusts.

513
00:49:31,775 --> 00:49:34,912
You swore the king an oath, my lord.

514
00:49:34,946 --> 00:49:38,047
He's spent half his life
fighting Robert's wars.

515
00:49:38,082 --> 00:49:40,583
He owes him nothing.

516
00:49:42,419 --> 00:49:45,521
Your father and brother
rode south once

517
00:49:45,555 --> 00:49:48,423
on a king's demand.

518
00:49:50,226 --> 00:49:52,427
A different time.

519
00:49:53,863 --> 00:49:55,930
A different king.

520
00:50:56,893 --> 00:50:58,694
When do I meet with the Khal?

521
00:50:58,729 --> 00:51:00,596
We need to begin
planning the invasion.

522
00:51:00,631 --> 00:51:03,098
If Khal Drogo has
promised you a crown,

523
00:51:03,132 --> 00:51:05,100
- you shall have it.
- When?

524
00:51:05,134 --> 00:51:07,235
When their omens favor war.

525
00:51:07,269 --> 00:51:10,538
I piss on Dothraki omens.

526
00:51:10,573 --> 00:51:13,809
I've waited 17 years
to get my throne back.

527
00:52:13,671 --> 00:52:15,138
A Dothraki wedding

528
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:18,709
without at least three deaths
is considered a dull affair.

529
00:52:31,255 --> 00:52:33,423
<i>Jadi, zhey Jorah Andahli!</i>

530
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:35,325
<i>Khal vezhven.</i>

531
00:52:41,065 --> 00:52:44,100
A small gift,
for the new khaleesi...

532
00:52:45,336 --> 00:52:47,638
Songs and Histories
from the Seven Kingdoms.

533
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,740
Thank you, ser.

534
00:52:52,343 --> 00:52:55,078
Are you from my country?

535
00:52:55,112 --> 00:52:57,280
Ser Jorah Mormont
of Bear Island.

536
00:52:57,315 --> 00:53:00,049
I served your father for many years.

537
00:53:00,083 --> 00:53:03,185
Gods be good, I hope to always
serve the rightful king.

538
00:53:26,311 --> 00:53:28,913
Dragon's eggs, Daenerys,

539
00:53:28,948 --> 00:53:31,917
from the Shadow Lands
beyond Asshai.

540
00:53:31,951 --> 00:53:34,986
The ages have
turned them to stone,

541
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:37,122
but they will always be beautiful.

542
00:53:39,259 --> 00:53:41,561
Thank you, magister.

543
00:54:49,363 --> 00:54:51,831
She's beautiful.

544
00:54:55,903 --> 00:54:58,271
Ser Jorah,
I don't know how to say

545
00:54:58,306 --> 00:55:00,140
thank you in Dothraki.

546
00:55:00,175 --> 00:55:03,110
There is no word
for thank you in Dothraki.

547
00:55:24,198 --> 00:55:26,199
Make him happy.

548
00:56:25,461 --> 00:56:27,662
No.

549
00:56:30,699 --> 00:56:32,867
Do you know the common tongue?

550
00:56:37,306 --> 00:56:39,340
No.

551
00:56:43,212 --> 00:56:45,780
Is "no" the only word that you know?

552
00:56:46,882 --> 00:56:48,616
<i>No.</i>

553
00:57:16,912 --> 00:57:19,146
Rough night, Imp?

554
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:21,248
If I get through this
without squirting

555
00:57:21,283 --> 00:57:23,684
from one end or the other
it'll be a miracle.

556
00:57:23,718 --> 00:57:26,086
I didn't pick you for a hunter.

557
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:29,222
The greatest in the land...
my spear never misses.

558
00:57:30,424 --> 00:57:32,993
It's not hunting
if you pay for it.

559
00:57:41,135 --> 00:57:43,403
Are you as good with a
spear as you used to be?

560
00:57:43,437 --> 00:57:45,972
No, but I'm still better than you.

561
00:57:49,043 --> 00:57:50,910
I know what I'm
putting you through.

562
00:57:50,945 --> 00:57:52,946
Thank you for saying yes.

563
00:57:54,381 --> 00:57:56,816
I only ask you
because I need you.

564
00:57:58,018 --> 00:57:59,919
You're a loyal friend.

565
00:57:59,954 --> 00:58:03,256
You hear me?
A <i>loyal</i> friend.

566
00:58:03,291 --> 00:58:05,091
The last one I've got.

567
00:58:06,727 --> 00:58:08,895
- I hope I'll serve you well.
- You will.

568
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:13,366
And I'll make sure you don't look
so fucking grim all the time.

569
00:58:14,634 --> 00:58:17,070
<i>Come on, boys,</i>
<i>let's go kill some boar!</i>

570
00:58:27,014 --> 00:58:29,182
Come on, you.

571
00:59:43,493 --> 00:59:46,027
Stop!

572
00:59:46,062 --> 00:59:47,929
Stop.

573
00:59:52,735 --> 00:59:55,004
Are you completely mad?

574
00:59:55,038 --> 00:59:57,940
- He saw us.
- It's all right, it's all right.

575
00:59:57,974 --> 00:59:59,842
- It's all right.
- He saw us!

576
00:59:59,876 --> 01:00:02,145
I heard you the first time.

577
01:00:06,117 --> 01:00:08,552
Quite the little climber,
aren't you?

578
01:00:09,688 --> 01:00:12,623
- How old are you, boy?
- 10.

579
01:00:12,657 --> 01:00:14,357
10.

580
01:00:23,066 --> 01:00:25,568
The things I do for love.

581
