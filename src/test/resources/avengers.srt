1
00:00:26,397 --> 00:00:29,206
The Tesseract has awakened.

2
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:35,536
It is on a neutral world, a human world.

3
00:00:36,942 --> 00:00:39,540
They wield its power,

4
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:46,417
but our ally knows it's working,
so that they never will learn.

5
00:00:47,632 --> 00:00:56,606
He's ready to lead, and our force,
our Chitauri will follow.

6
00:00:58,073 --> 00:01:02,964
The world will be his and the universe yours.

7
00:01:03,777 --> 00:01:09,703
And the humans, what can they do, but burn.

8
00:01:59,323 --> 00:02:00,338
How bad is it?

9
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,244
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

10
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,867
Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from
the Tesseract four hours ago.

11
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:13,013
NASA didn't authorize Selvig to
pull the test phase.

12
00:02:13,013 --> 00:02:16,695
He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in the room.
Spontaneous advancement

13
00:02:16,695 --> 00:02:17,670
It just turned itself on?

14
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,891
What are the engine levels now?

15
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:21,521
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't
shut it down, we ordered the evac.

16
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:22,635
How long to get everyone out?

17
00:02:22,635 --> 00:02:24,116
Campus should be clear in the next half hour.

18
00:02:24,385 --> 00:02:25,539
Do better.

19
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:28,872
Sir, evacuation maybe futile.

20
00:02:28,872 --> 00:02:30,431
We should tell them to go back to sleep?

21
00:02:30,431 --> 00:02:32,582
If we can't control the Tesseract's energy,

22
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:34,863
there may not be a minimum safe distance.

23
00:02:35,116 --> 00:02:38,265
I need you to make sure that phase
2 prototypes are shipped out.

24
00:02:38,265 --> 00:02:40,600
Sir, is that really a priority right now?

25
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,596
Until such time as the world ends,
we will act as though it intends to spin on.

26
00:02:44,928 --> 00:02:48,933
Clear out the tech below. Every piece
of phase two on a truck and gone.

27
00:02:49,134 --> 00:02:52,203
Yes, sir. Come with me.

28
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:57,143
Talk to me,  Doctor.

29
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:58,918
Director.

30
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:01,380
Is there anything we know for certain?

31
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,786
- Tesseract is misbehaving.
- Is that supposed to be funny?

32
00:03:04,986 --> 00:03:06,831
No, it's not funny at all.

33
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:10,591
The Tesseract is not only active,
she's...misbehaving.

34
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:11,618
How soon until you pull the plug?

35
00:03:11,913 --> 00:03:12,879
She's an energy source.

36
00:03:13,562 --> 00:03:16,733
If we turn off the power, she turns it back on.

37
00:03:16,932 --> 00:03:20,036
-  If she reaches peak level...
- We've prepared for this, doctor.

38
00:03:20,236 --> 00:03:23,139
- Harnessing energy from space.
- We don't have the harness.

39
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,546
Our calculations are far from complete.
Now she's throwing off interference, radiation

40
00:03:27,746 --> 00:03:30,482
Nothing harmful,
low levels of gamma radiation.

41
00:03:30,682 --> 00:03:34,554
That can be harmful.
Where's Agent Barton?

42
00:03:34,754 --> 00:03:39,326
The Hawk?  Up in his nest, as usual.

43
00:03:40,426 --> 00:03:42,463
Agent Barton, report to me.

44
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,900
I gave you this detail so you could
keep a close eye on things.

45
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,570
- I can see better from a distance.
- Are you seeing anything that might

46
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:52,441
- set this thing off?
- Doctor, it's spiking again.

47
00:03:52,641 --> 00:03:55,846
No one come or gone.
It's oven is clean.

48
00:03:56,046 --> 00:03:58,682
No contacts, no I.M.'s.

49
00:03:58,882 --> 00:04:01,752
If there was any tampering, sir.
It wasn't at this end.

50
00:04:02,553 --> 00:04:08,025
- At this end?
- Yes, a cube of space, one end of the door.

51
00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:11,731
Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right?
The doors open from both sides.

52
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,551
Sir, please put down the spear!

53
00:06:03,294 --> 00:06:05,362
You have a heart.

54
00:06:35,165 --> 00:06:37,167
Please don't.

55
00:06:38,368 --> 00:06:41,571
- I still need that.
- This doesn't have to get any messier.

56
00:06:41,771 --> 00:06:45,943
Of course it does.
I've come too far for anything else.

57
00:06:46,678 --> 00:06:50,349
I am Loki of Asgard,

58
00:06:50,549 --> 00:06:56,323
- and I am burdened with glorious purpose.
- Loki, brother of Thor?

59
00:06:56,522 --> 00:06:58,992
We have no quarrel with your people.

60
00:06:59,193 --> 00:07:02,631
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

61
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:07,736
- You planning to step on us?
- I come with glad tidings,

62
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,541
- of a world made free.
- Free from what?

63
00:07:12,742 --> 00:07:17,147
Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie.

64
00:07:17,347 --> 00:07:21,953
Once you accept that, in your heart...

65
00:07:25,424 --> 00:07:27,426
You will know peace.

66
00:07:27,626 --> 00:07:31,997
Yeah, you say peace, I kind of
think you mean the other piece.

67
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:36,504
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.
This place is about to blow

68
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:40,442
Drop a hundred feet of raw material,
he means to bury us.

69
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:41,976
- Like The Pharaohs of Odin.
- He was right.

70
00:07:42,049 --> 00:07:43,605
The portal is collapsing in on itself.

71
00:07:43,882 --> 00:07:46,000
You got maybe two minutes
before this goes critical.

72
00:07:47,115 --> 00:07:49,152
Drop him.

73
00:08:02,835 --> 00:08:05,171
Need these vehicles.

74
00:08:07,908 --> 00:08:10,744
- Who's that?
- He didn't tell me.

75
00:08:13,147 --> 00:08:18,654
Hill, do you copy? Barton is....

76
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:34,940
He's got the Tesseract! Track it down!

77
00:09:11,282 --> 00:09:14,335
ets go, no no no.. leave leave, go.

78
00:09:29,638 --> 00:09:32,909
We cleared upstairs, sir.
We need to go.

79
00:11:04,283 --> 00:11:07,586
Director? Director Fury , do you copy?

80
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:11,103
The Tesseract is with the hostile force.
I have men down. Hill?

81
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:16,039
A lot of men still under,
don't know how many survivors.

82
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:19,454
Sound the general call,
I want every living soul not needing rescue

83
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:21,518
- looking for that briefcase.
- Roger that.

84
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:24,777
Coulson, get back to base.
This is a level seven.

85
00:11:25,507 --> 00:11:29,655
As of right now, we are at war.

86
00:11:30,484 --> 00:11:32,476
What do we do?

87
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,971
I do not want to end tonight.

88
00:12:12,104 --> 00:12:14,228
I want to know how
for it to end.

89
00:12:14,361 --> 00:12:17,348
Believe me, you must
to be better prepared.

90
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,994
Do you work?
Lermentoville?

91
00:12:23,188 --> 00:12:27,203
Is he confident that we will do -

92
00:12:27,337 --> 00:12:30,059
transport without him?

93
00:12:30,324 --> 00:12:35,070
I thought that a General
Tchalakov handle exports.

94
00:12:35,203 --> 00:12:39,916
Tchalakov. Running Boy, doll.

95
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:46,588
Outdated information
derived from the fall.

96
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:51,466
Famous Black Widow

97
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:57,074
it's just a pretty face.

98
00:12:57,207 --> 00:13:00,659
Do I feel beautiful?

99
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:09,686
We do not need Lermentovia
transport tank.

100
00:13:10,283 --> 00:13:14,796
Tell him that we give up
medium term by hand. It's true ...

101
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:20,473
You may have to write it down.

102
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:27,076
Yes?

103
00:13:28,671 --> 00:13:30,794
You ask.

104
00:13:33,283 --> 00:13:37,731
- Listen carefully ...
- Silenskin box 114, the third floor.

105
00:13:37,863 --> 00:13:40,817
F-22 close to you 13 draw
kilometer radius.

106
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,062
Put the woman on the phone,

107
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,517
or I will blow up the block
before you can make the lobby.

108
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,059
- We need you to come in.
- Are you kidding? I'm working!

109
00:13:54,193 --> 00:13:57,079
- This takes precedence.
- I'm in the middle of an interrogation and this

110
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,469
moron is giving me everything.

111
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:03,052
I don't give everything.

112
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,904
- Look, you can't pull me out
of this right now. - Natasha.

113
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:10,057
Barton's been compromised.

114
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,471
Let me put you on hold.

115
00:14:56,455 --> 00:14:58,280
- Where's Barton now?
- We don't know.

116
00:14:58,412 --> 00:15:00,338
- But he's alive.
- We think so.

117
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,613
I'll brief you on everything when you get back.

118
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:03,686
But first, we need you to talk to the big guy.

119
00:15:04,685 --> 00:15:07,938
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts
me about as far as he can throw me.

120
00:15:08,071 --> 00:15:12,220
No, I've got Stark.
You get the big guy.

121
00:15:14,941 --> 00:15:16,666
Oh, God.

122
00:15:33,194 --> 00:15:36,248
- Do not come here!
- Who are you?

123
00:15:36,381 --> 00:15:40,364
Go away. Here is a disease.

124
00:15:40,496 --> 00:15:44,513
Are you a doctor?
My father did not wake up!

125
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:47,731
Body heat, and he
make noise, but did not open his eyes.

126
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,722
A slower rate.

127
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,411
My father ...

128
00:15:53,573 --> 00:15:55,663
And when they?

129
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:00,873
Please...

130
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:29,715
Should have got paid up front, Banner.

131
00:16:29,847 --> 00:16:33,513
You know, for a man who's
supposed to be avoiding stress,

132
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,289
you picked a hell of a place to settle.

133
00:16:37,492 --> 00:16:42,492
- Avoiding stress isn't the secret.
-Then what is it? Yoga?

134
00:16:43,632 --> 00:16:47,591
ou brought me to the edge of the city, smart.

135
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:51,116
I uh...assume the whole place is surrounded?

136
00:16:52,056 --> 00:16:54,170
Just you and me.

137
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,237
And your actress buddy, is she a spy too?
Do you start that young?

138
00:16:59,372 --> 00:17:01,721
- I did.
- Who are you?

139
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,438
Natasha Romanoff.

140
00:17:06,518 --> 00:17:08,190
Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff?

141
00:17:08,035 --> 00:17:11,035
Because that's not gonna
work out for everyone.

142
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:14,103
No. No. Of course not.
I'm here on behalf of SHIELD.

143
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:19,573
SHIELD. How did they find me?

144
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,592
We never lost you, doctor.
We've kept our distance,

145
00:17:22,726 --> 00:17:26,385
even helped keep some
other interested parties off your scent.

146
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:30,009
- Why?
- Nick Fury seems to trust you.

147
00:17:30,142 --> 00:17:32,492
But now I need you to come in.

148
00:17:32,827 --> 00:17:37,157
- What if I say no?
- I'll persuade you.

149
00:17:39,137 --> 00:17:43,129
And what if the...other guy says no?

150
00:17:44,135 --> 00:17:45,759
You've been more than a
year without an incident.

151
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:47,863
I don't think you wanna break that streak.

152
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,869
I don't get every time what I want.

153
00:17:54,504 --> 00:17:58,297
Doctor, we're facing a
potential global catastrophe.

154
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:02,759
- Well, those I actively try to avoid.
- This is the

155
00:18:03,363 --> 00:18:05,646
Tesseract.

156
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,639
It has the potential energy
to wipe out the planet.

157
00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:13,049
What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it?

158
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:16,250
Well, he wants you to find it. It's been taken.

159
00:18:17,425 --> 00:18:21,653
It omits a gamma signature
that's too weak for us to trace.

160
00:18:21,788 --> 00:18:24,706
There's no one that knows
gamma radiation like you do.

161
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,261
If there was, that's where I'd be.

162
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:32,122
- So Fury isn't after the monster?
- Not that he's told me.

163
00:18:32,257 --> 00:18:34,707
And he tells you everything?

164
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:37,726
- Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.
- He needs me in a cage?

165
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,150
- No one's gonna put you in a...
- Stop lying to me!

166
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:46,687
I'm sorry, that was mean.

167
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:50,209
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

168
00:18:51,115 --> 00:18:55,647
Why don't we do this the easy way,
where you don't use that,

169
00:18:55,781 --> 00:19:00,344
and the other guy doesn't
make a mess? Okay?

170
00:19:00,477 --> 00:19:04,236
Natasha.

171
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:13,364
Stand down. We're good here.

172
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:17,458
Just you and me?

173
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:21,586
This is out of line, Director.

174
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:24,372
You're dealing with
forces you can't control.

175
00:19:24,504 --> 00:19:28,030
You ever been in a war,
Councilman? In a firefight?

176
00:19:28,163 --> 00:19:30,914
Did you feel an over abundance of control?

177
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:34,471
You saying that this Asgard has
declared war on our planet?

178
00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:37,290
Not Asgard. Loki.

179
00:19:37,425 --> 00:19:41,282
He can't be working alone.
What about the other one? His brother.

180
00:19:41,418 --> 00:19:43,599
Our intelligence says, Thor is not a hostile.

181
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:46,233
But he's worlds away,
we can't depend on him to help either.

182
00:19:46,003 --> 00:19:47,294
It's up to us.

183
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:49,578
Which is why you should
be focusing on phase two,

184
00:19:49,592 --> 00:19:54,424
- it was designed for exactly...
- Phase two isn't ready, our enemy is.

185
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:58,586
- We need a response team.
- The Avengers Initiative was shut down.

186
00:19:58,851 --> 00:20:01,578
- This isn't about The Avengers.
- We have seen the list.

187
00:20:01,593 --> 00:20:04,067
We're running the world's greatest
covert security network

188
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,181
and you're gonna leave the fate of
human race to a handful of freaks.

189
00:20:07,382 --> 00:20:11,830
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.
We need a response team.

190
00:20:12,032 --> 00:20:14,776
These people may be isolated,
unbalanced even,

191
00:20:14,978 --> 00:20:19,191
but I believe with the right push
they can be exactly what we need.

192
00:20:19,392 --> 00:20:24,678
- You believe?
- War isn't won by sentiment, Director.

193
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,928
No, it's won by soldiers.

194
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:52,352
There's not enough time. I'm gotta
pull into the water.

195
00:20:57,135 --> 00:21:00,248
- You wont be alone.
- .Oh God.

196
00:21:00,648 --> 00:21:03,092
This guy is still alive.

197
00:21:27,122 --> 00:21:29,364
Trouble sleeping?

198
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:33,880
I slept for 70 years, Sir.
I think I've had my fill.

199
00:21:34,382 --> 00:21:39,133
Then you should be out,
celebrating, seeing the world.

200
00:21:44,186 --> 00:21:47,030
I went under, the world was at war,

201
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:51,815
I wake up, they say we won.
They didn't say what we lost.

202
00:21:52,017 --> 00:21:56,936
We've made some mistakes along the way.
Some very recently.

203
00:21:58,005 --> 00:22:00,212
- You here with a mission, sir?
- I am.

204
00:22:00,415 --> 00:22:04,431
- Trying to get me back in the world?
- Trying to save it.

205
00:22:08,946 --> 00:22:10,954
Hydra's secret weapon.

206
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:14,871
Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean
when he was looking for you.

207
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:18,517
He thought what we think,
the Tesseract could be the key to

208
00:22:18,716 --> 00:22:21,428
unlimited sustainable energy.

209
00:22:21,627 --> 00:22:25,041
That's something the world sorely needs.

210
00:22:26,948 --> 00:22:29,794
- Who took it from you?
- He's called Loki.

211
00:22:29,993 --> 00:22:32,704
He's not from around here.

212
00:22:33,072 --> 00:22:36,785
There's a lot we'll have to bring
you up to speed on if you're in.

213
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:40,967
The world has gotten even
stranger than you already know.

214
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:43,948
At this point, I doubt
anything would surprise me.

215
00:22:44,414 --> 00:22:46,991
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

216
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:51,675
There's a debriefing package waiting
for you back at your apartment.

217
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:55,626
Is there anything you can tell us about...

218
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:57,263
...the Tesseract that we ought to know now?

219
00:22:57,564 --> 00:23:00,240
You should have left it in the ocean.

220
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,507
You're good to go on this end.
The rest is up to you.

221
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:38,084
You disconnected the transition lines?
Are we off the grid?

222
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:42,133
Stark Towers is about to become a
beacon of self sustaining clean energy.

223
00:23:42,335 --> 00:23:45,613
Wow, so maybe our reactor takes over
and it actually works?

224
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:49,126
I assume. Light her up.

225
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:58,160
- How does it look?
- Like Christmas, but with more...me.

226
00:23:58,362 --> 00:24:00,443
Gotta go wider on the public
awareness campaign.

227
00:24:00,443 --> 00:24:01,836
You need to do some press.

228
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:03,073
I can do some more tomorrow,

229
00:24:03,073 --> 00:24:05,399
I'm working on the zoning
for the next billboards.

230
00:24:04,714 --> 00:24:06,467
Pepper, you're killing me. Remember?

231
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,305
Enjoy the moment.

232
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,743
I remember.

233
00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:16,263
Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line.

234
00:24:16,464 --> 00:24:19,776
I'm not in. I'm actually out.

235
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:29,380
Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.

236
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:32,792
Close the line Jarvis. I got a date.

237
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,818
Levels are holding steady...I think.

238
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:42,422
Of course they are,
I was directly involved.

239
00:24:42,422 --> 00:24:43,770
Which brings me to my next question.

240
00:24:43,805 --> 00:24:45,850
How does it feel to be a genius?

241
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,387
Well, ha, I really wouldn't
know now, would I?

242
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,509
What do you mean?
All this, came from you.

243
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:56,489
No. All this, came from that.

244
00:24:57,058 --> 00:25:00,301
Give yourself some credit, please.
Stark Tower...

245
00:25:00,502 --> 00:25:04,214
...is your baby. Give yourself,
twelve percent of the credit.

246
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,587
- Twelve percent?
- An argument can be made for fifteen.

247
00:25:06,786 --> 00:25:10,664
- Twelve percent for my baby?
- Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.

248
00:25:10,866 --> 00:25:12,192
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.

249
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:15,645
And sorry, but the security snafu?
That was on you.

250
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,154
- My private elevator.
- You mean our elevator?

251
00:25:18,354 --> 00:25:21,396
It was teeming with sweaty workmen.

252
00:25:21,596 --> 00:25:24,117
I'm going to pay for that
comment about percentages

253
00:25:24,117 --> 00:25:25,845
in some subtle way later on, aren't I?

254
00:25:26,644 --> 00:25:29,320
Not gonna be that subtle.

255
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,760
I'll tell you what. Next building
is gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.

256
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,541
- On the lease.
- Call your mom, can you bunk over?

257
00:25:36,741 --> 00:25:40,386
Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid
my protocol's are being overwritten.

258
00:25:40,588 --> 00:25:42,992
Stark, we need to talk.

259
00:25:43,193 --> 00:25:45,629
You have reached the life model
decoy of Tony Stark,

260
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:46,932
please leave a message.

261
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:49,713
- This is urgent.
- Then leave it urgently.

262
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:53,290
- Security breach. That's on you.
- Mr Stark.

263
00:25:53,491 --> 00:25:56,063
- Phil! Come in.
- Phil.

264
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:58,940
- I can't stay.
- Uh...his first name is Agent.

265
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,915
Come on in, we're celebrating.

266
00:26:01,013 --> 00:26:02,382
Which is why he can't stay.

267
00:26:04,656 --> 00:26:05,558
Soon as possible.

268
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:06,719
I don't like being handed things

269
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,512
That's alright, cause
I love to be handed things.

270
00:26:08,547 --> 00:26:09,973
So, let's trade.

271
00:26:11,275 --> 00:26:13,282
Thank you.

272
00:26:13,716 --> 00:26:16,692
Official consulting hours are between
eight and five every other Thursday.

273
00:26:16,892 --> 00:26:19,935
- This isn't a consultation.
- Is this about The Avengers?

274
00:26:20,136 --> 00:26:21,479
Which I...I know nothing about.

275
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:24,757
The Avengers Initiative
was scrapped, I thought.

276
00:26:24,991 --> 00:26:27,123
- And I didn't even qualify.
- I didn't know that either.

277
00:26:27,324 --> 00:26:30,308
Yeah, apparently I'm volatile,
self obsessed,

278
00:26:30,308 --> 00:26:31,933
don't play well with others.

279
00:26:32,171 --> 00:26:32,761
That I did know.

280
00:26:32,761 --> 00:26:35,357
- This isn't about personality profiles anymore.
- Whatever.

281
00:26:35,714 --> 00:26:39,025
Miss Potts, got a sec?

282
00:26:43,838 --> 00:26:46,401
You know, I thought we were having a moment.

283
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,157
I was having twelve percent of a moment.

284
00:26:49,306 --> 00:26:51,779
This seems so serious,
Phil's pretty shaken.

285
00:26:51,981 --> 00:26:55,855
- How did you notice? Why is he Phil?
- What is all this?

286
00:26:56,056 --> 00:26:58,094
This is uh...

287
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,329
This.

288
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:08,915
- I'm going to take the jet to D.C. tonight.
- Tomorrow.

289
00:27:09,115 --> 00:27:11,619
You have homework.
You have a lot of homework.

290
00:27:11,822 --> 00:27:13,958
Well, what if I didn't?

291
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:18,102
If you didn't?
You mean if you finished?

292
00:27:19,136 --> 00:27:22,977
Then ...

293
00:27:27,552 --> 00:27:29,958
Square deal. It's the last date.

294
00:27:32,964 --> 00:27:35,235
Work hard.

295
00:27:37,005 --> 00:27:39,879
- Do you drive past the airport, by chance?
- I can drop you.

296
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,855
Oh, fantastic. Does the cellist
You? Is it true relationship?

297
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:47,761
- He moved back to Portland.
- What?

298
00:27:56,246 --> 00:27:59,120
We are a forty-minute
from the base, sir.

299
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:07,145
So this Dr. Banner was trying to replicate
the serum that was used on me?

300
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,311
A lot of people were.
You were the world's first superhero.

301
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,168
Banner thought gammer radiation might

302
00:28:13,168 --> 00:28:15,558
hold the key to unlocking
Erskine's original formula.

303
00:28:15,754 --> 00:28:19,033
- Didn't really go his way, did it?
- Not so much.

304
00:28:19,237 --> 00:28:23,020
When he's got that thing though,
guy's like a Stephen Hawking.

305
00:28:24,273 --> 00:28:27,416
He's like a smart person.

306
00:28:28,837 --> 00:28:33,503
I gotta say, it's an honor
to meet you, officially.

307
00:28:33,705 --> 00:28:37,628
I sort of met you, I mean,
I watched you while you were sleeping.

308
00:28:38,846 --> 00:28:44,728
I mean, I was...I was present while you
were unconscious from the ice.

309
00:28:44,862 --> 00:28:49,123
You know, it's really, it's just a...just
a huge honor to have you on board.

310
00:28:49,598 --> 00:28:54,229
- Well, I hope I'm the man for the job.
- Oh, you are. Absolutely.

311
00:28:54,534 --> 00:28:59,706
Uh...we've made some modifications
to the uniform. I had a little design input.

312
00:28:59,841 --> 00:29:06,299
The uniform? Aren't the stars
and stripes a little...old fashioned?

313
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:11,539
Everything that's happening, the
things that are about to come to light,

314
00:29:12,386 --> 00:29:15,901
people might just need a little old fashioned.

315
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:53,226
- The Chitauri grow restless.
- Let them grow restless.

316
00:29:53,663 --> 00:29:57,079
- I will lead them in the glorious battle.
- Battle? Against a meagre might of earth?

317
00:29:57,485 --> 00:30:02,252
- Glorious, not lengthy.

318
00:30:02,387 --> 00:30:07,966
If your force is as formidable as you claim.

319
00:30:08,134 --> 00:30:10,400
You question us?

320
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:15,404
Question him?
He who put the scepter in your hand?

321
00:30:15,541 --> 00:30:18,886
Who gave you ancient
knowledge and new purpose?

322
00:30:19,189 --> 00:30:21,230
When you were cast out, defeated!

323
00:30:21,232 --> 00:30:26,845
I was a king! The rightful king
of Asgard. Betrayed.

324
00:30:27,453 --> 00:30:33,026
Your ambition is little and full of childish need.

325
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:36,594
We look beyond the earth to great worlds

326
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:39,300
The Tesseract will avail.

327
00:30:39,308 --> 00:30:41,708
You don't have the Tesseract yet.

328
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:45,766
I don't threaten.

329
00:30:46,172 --> 00:30:48,740
But until I open the doors,

330
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:54,223
until your force is mine to
command, you are the wars.

331
00:30:55,476 --> 00:31:01,189
You will have your war as guardian.

332
00:31:01,118 --> 00:31:03,822
If you fail,

333
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:08,793
if the Tesseract is kept from us,

334
00:31:08,964 --> 00:31:12,881
there will be no realm, no barren moon,

335
00:31:13,661 --> 00:31:16,873
no crevasse where I can't find you.

336
00:31:18,361 --> 00:31:20,965
You think you know pain?

337
00:31:21,336 --> 00:31:27,861
You will receive something sweet as pain.

338
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,943
- Get your captain equipment.
- All right.

339
00:31:59,497 --> 00:32:02,641
Agent Romanoff , he's Captain Rogers.

340
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:09,371
- They need you on the bridge.
- See you there.

341
00:32:09,551 --> 00:32:13,372
There was quite the buzz
around here, finding you in the ice.

342
00:32:13,982 --> 00:32:16,314
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.

343
00:32:16,888 --> 00:32:19,628
Did he ask you to sign his
Captain America trading cards yet?

344
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,056
- Trading Cards?
- They're vintage, he's very proud.

345
00:32:25,408 --> 00:32:27,438
Dr. Banner.

346
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:30,310
Oh, yeah. Hi.

347
00:32:30,447 --> 00:32:33,930
- They told me you'd be coming.
- Word is you can find the cube.

348
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:38,528
- Is that the only word on me?
- Only word I care about.

349
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:43,192
Must be strange for you, all of this.

350
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:45,501
Well, this is actually kind of familiar.

351
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:48,690
Gentlemen, you may wanna
step inside in a minute.

352
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:51,646
It's gonna get a little hard to breath.

353
00:32:59,273 --> 00:33:01,408
Is this is a submarine?

354
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:06,344
Really? They wanted me in a submerged
pressurized metal container?

355
00:33:32,821 --> 00:33:33,786
Oh, no. This is much worse.

356
00:34:22,313 --> 00:34:23,737
- All engine operating.

357
00:34:23,738 --> 00:34:28,236
SHEILD emergency
protocol, 1 9 3.6 in effect.

358
00:34:29,124 --> 00:34:31,166
- We're in, sir.
- Good.

359
00:34:31,201 --> 00:34:35,445
- Lets vanish.
- Engage retro reflection panels.

360
00:34:50,151 --> 00:34:55,388
- Reflection panels engaged.
- Gentlemen.

361
00:35:05,593 --> 00:35:12,827
- Doctor, thank you for coming.
- Thanks for asking nicely.

362
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:15,527
So, uh...how long am I staying?

363
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:18,515
Once we get our hands on the
Tesseract, you're in the clear.

364
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,901
Where are you with that?

365
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:24,302
We're sweeping every
wirelessly accessible camera on the planet.

366
00:35:24,438 --> 00:35:28,335
Cell phones, laptops.
If it's connected to a satellite,

367
00:35:28,538 --> 00:35:31,437
-  it's eyes and ears for us.
- That's still not gonna find them in time.

368
00:35:31,638 --> 00:35:32,886
You have to narrow the field.

369
00:35:32,886 --> 00:35:35,286
How many spectrometers
do you have access to?

370
00:35:35,321 --> 00:35:37,074
- How many are there?
- Call every lab you know,

371
00:35:37,207 --> 00:35:38,937
tell them to put the
spectrometers on the roof

372
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:40,731
and calibrate them for gamma rays.

373
00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:43,744
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm
based on cluster recognition.

374
00:35:43,943 --> 00:35:46,510
At least we could rule out a few places.

375
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:49,781
- Do you have somewhere for me to work?
- Agent Romanoff,

376
00:35:49,913 --> 00:35:52,746
would you show Dr. Banner
to his laboratory, please.

377
00:35:53,412 --> 00:35:55,881
You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys.

378
00:35:55,948 --> 00:35:57,648
Put over there.

379
00:36:05,518 --> 00:36:07,920
- Is this the stuff you need?
- Yeah, Iridium.

380
00:36:08,121 --> 00:36:10,721
It's found in meteorites, it forms anti-protons.

381
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:14,322
- It's very hard to get hold of
- Specially if SHIELD knows you need it.

382
00:36:14,656 --> 00:36:16,657
Well, I didn't know!

383
00:36:17,658 --> 00:36:19,439
The Tesseract is showing me so much.

384
00:36:19,695 --> 00:36:22,703
It's...it's more than knowledge, it's truth.

385
00:36:22,738 --> 00:36:25,827
I know. What did it show you,
Agent Barton?

386
00:36:27,193 --> 00:36:30,196
- My next target.
- Tell me what you need.

387
00:36:33,162 --> 00:36:35,333
I need a distraction.

388
00:36:35,964 --> 00:36:37,998
And an eyeball.

389
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,736
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

390
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,137
No, no. It's fine.

391
00:36:51,138 --> 00:36:52,290
It's a vintage set.

392
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,728
It took me a couple of
years to collect them all.

393
00:36:57,773 --> 00:37:00,640
Near mint, slight foxing
around the edges, but...

394
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:03,274
We got a hit. Sixty seven percent match.

395
00:37:03,843 --> 00:37:06,678
Weight, cross match, seventy nine percent.

396
00:37:05,966 --> 00:37:07,321
Location?

397
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:10,195
Stuttgart, Germany.
28, Canning Strasse.

398
00:37:11,047 --> 00:37:13,749
- He's not exactly hiding.
- Captain,

399
00:37:14,179 --> 00:37:16,180
you're up.

400
00:39:49,776 --> 00:39:52,311
Kneel before me.

401
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:58,780
I said.

402
00:39:58,882 --> 00:40:01,546
Kneel!

403
00:40:10,279 --> 00:40:14,043
Is not this simpler?

404
00:40:15,378 --> 00:40:18,877
Is this not your natural state?

405
00:40:20,808 --> 00:40:24,108
It's the unspoken truth of humanity,

406
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:27,107
that you crave subjugation.

407
00:40:27,307 --> 00:40:29,826
The bright lure of freedom diminishes

408
00:40:29,848 --> 00:40:34,673
your life's joy in a mad scramble for power,

409
00:40:35,804 --> 00:40:38,536
and identity.

410
00:40:38,744 --> 00:40:42,577
You were made to be ruled.

411
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:47,266
In the end, you will always kneel.

412
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,780
Not to men like you.

413
00:40:57,208 --> 00:41:03,085
- There are no men like me.
- There are always men like you.

414
00:41:04,176 --> 00:41:06,721
Look to your elder, people.

415
00:41:08,273 --> 00:41:11,048
Let him be an example.

416
00:41:16,498 --> 00:41:18,394
You know, the last time I was in Germany

417
00:41:18,394 --> 00:41:21,701
and saw a man standing
above everybody else,

418
00:41:22,673 --> 00:41:23,830
we ended up disagreeing.

419
00:41:29,827 --> 00:41:33,925
I'm not the one who's out of time.

420
00:41:34,518 --> 00:41:37,658
Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.

421
00:41:57,408 --> 00:41:59,060
Kneel.

422
00:41:59,259 --> 00:42:01,239
Not today!

423
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,203
The guy's all over the place.

424
00:42:07,218 --> 00:42:10,025
Agent Romanoff, did you miss me?

425
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:29,018
Make your move, Reindeer names.

426
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:38,399
Good move.

427
00:42:39,389 --> 00:42:42,592
- Mr Stark.
- Captain.

428
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:52,933
- Didn't he say anything?
- Not a word.

429
00:42:53,131 --> 00:42:55,673
Just get in here.
We're low on time.

430
00:42:58,314 --> 00:42:59,370
I don't like it.

431
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,775
What? Rock of Ages
giving up so easily?

432
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:03,042
I don't remember it being that easy.

433
00:43:03,042 --> 00:43:05,141
This guy packs a wallop.

434
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:08,651
Still, you were pretty spry,
for an older fellow.

435
00:43:09,676 --> 00:43:12,120
- What's your thing? Pilates?
- What?

436
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:15,852
It's like calisthenics.
You might have missed a couple things,

437
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:18,196
you know, doing time as a Capsicle.

438
00:43:19,553 --> 00:43:21,360
Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.

439
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,705
Yeah, there's a lot of
things Fury doesn't tell you.

440
00:43:24,572 --> 00:43:26,555
Where's this coming from?

441
00:43:30,221 --> 00:43:32,961
What's the matter? Scared of a little lightning?

442
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,131
I'm not overly fond of what follows.

443
00:44:07,641 --> 00:44:10,583
- Now there's that guy.
- Another Asgardian?

444
00:44:11,012 --> 00:44:12,564
- Think the guy's a friendly?
- Doesn't matter.

445
00:44:12,761 --> 00:44:15,604
If he frees Loki or kills him,
the Tesseract's lost.

446
00:44:15,801 --> 00:44:20,920
- Stark, we need a plan of attack.
- I have a plan. Attack.

447
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:29,045
- I'd sit this one out, Cap.
- I don't see how I can.

448
00:44:29,244 --> 00:44:32,216
These guys come from legends,
they're basically Gods.

449
00:44:32,415 --> 00:44:33,774
There's only one God, ma'am.

450
00:44:33,774 --> 00:44:36,030
And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.

451
00:44:51,604 --> 00:44:54,643
- Where's the Tesseract?
- I missed you too.

452
00:44:54,842 --> 00:44:58,705
- Do I look to be in a gaming mood?
- Oh, you should thank me.

453
00:44:59,069 --> 00:45:01,686
With the Bifrost gone,
how much dark energy did the

454
00:45:01,687 --> 00:45:04,091
All-Father have to muster
to conjure you here?

455
00:45:04,286 --> 00:45:06,435
Your precious earth.

456
00:45:09,604 --> 00:45:11,719
I thought you dead.

457
00:45:15,814 --> 00:45:20,059
Our father...
- Your father.

458
00:45:21,496 --> 00:45:23,974
He did tell you my true parentage, did he not?

459
00:45:26,812 --> 00:45:29,157
We were raised together.

460
00:45:29,324 --> 00:45:31,801
We played together, we fought together.

461
00:45:32,494 --> 00:45:35,500
- Do you remember none of that?
- I remember a shadows.

462
00:45:37,252 --> 00:45:40,222
living in the shade of your greatness.

463
00:45:40,967 --> 00:45:43,741
I remember you tossing me into an abyss.

464
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,326
I who was and should be king!

465
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:50,384
So you take the world I love as
recompense for your imagined slights?

466
00:45:50,705 --> 00:45:53,545
No, the earth is under my protection, Loki.

467
00:45:54,434 --> 00:45:58,062
And you're doing a marvelous job with that.

468
00:45:58,492 --> 00:46:02,288
The humans slaughter each other in
droves, while you ideally threat.

469
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:05,492
I mean to rule them.
That's why should I not...

470
00:46:05,492 --> 00:46:06,900
Think yourself above them.

471
00:46:07,638 --> 00:46:08,678
Well, yes.

472
00:46:08,678 --> 00:46:11,404
Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother.

473
00:46:12,024 --> 00:46:14,862
A throne would suit you ill.

474
00:46:18,659 --> 00:46:21,201
I've seen worlds you've never known about.

475
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,890
I have grown, Odin's son, in my exile.

476
00:46:26,085 --> 00:46:29,769
I have seen the true power of the Tesseract.
And when I wield it...

477
00:46:29,782 --> 00:46:34,573
Who showed you this power?
Who controls the would be king?

478
00:46:34,686 --> 00:46:36,667
- I am the king!
- Not here!

479
00:46:36,865 --> 00:46:40,894
You give up the Tesseract!
You give up this poisonous dream!

480
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,512
You come home.

481
00:46:49,835 --> 00:46:51,948
I do not have it.

482
00:46:52,937 --> 00:46:57,889
You need the cube to bring me home,
but I've sent it off. I know not where.

483
00:46:58,385 --> 00:47:00,363
You listen well, brother.

484
00:47:01,807 --> 00:47:03,789
I'm listening.

485
00:47:12,207 --> 00:47:15,542
- Do not touch me again.
- Then don't take my stuff.

486
00:47:15,738 --> 00:47:19,368
You have no idea what you're dealing with.

487
00:47:20,031 --> 00:47:21,844
Uh...Shakespeare in the park.

488
00:47:22,043 --> 00:47:25,542
Doth mother know, you weareth her drapes?

489
00:47:25,741 --> 00:47:28,382
This is beyond you, metal man.

490
00:47:28,576 --> 00:47:30,790
Loki will face Asgardian justice.

491
00:47:30,988 --> 00:47:32,499
He gives up the cube and he's all yours.

492
00:47:32,499 --> 00:47:34,006
Until then,

493
00:47:34,298 --> 00:47:35,884
...stay out of the way.

494
00:47:37,525 --> 00:47:39,504
Tourist.

495
00:47:44,523 --> 00:47:46,504
Okay.

496
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:20,536
How about that.

497
00:49:23,914 --> 00:49:25,895
That's enough!

498
00:49:28,998 --> 00:49:30,313
Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here.

499
00:49:30,313 --> 00:49:33,185
I've come here to put
and end to Loki's schemes!

500
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,599
Then prove it. Put that hammer down.

501
00:49:35,797 --> 00:49:39,000
Uh...yep! No! Bad call!
He loves his hammer!

502
00:49:40,254 --> 00:49:42,630
You want me to put the hammer down?

503
00:50:09,997 --> 00:50:11,977
Are we done here?

504
00:50:59,355 --> 00:51:04,270
In case it's unclear, you try to escape,

505
00:51:05,951 --> 00:51:11,861
you so much as scratch that glass.

506
00:51:17,915 --> 00:51:22,188
Thirty thousand feet,
straight down in a steel trap.

507
00:51:22,387 --> 00:51:24,725
You get how that works?

508
00:51:26,694 --> 00:51:29,532
Ant.
Boot.

509
00:51:32,538 --> 00:51:34,708
It's an impressive cage.

510
00:51:35,143 --> 00:51:37,946
Not built, I think, for me.

511
00:51:38,147 --> 00:51:40,417
Built for something a lot stronger than you.

512
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,621
Oh, I've heard.

513
00:51:43,657 --> 00:51:48,499
The mindless beast, makes play to be the man.

514
00:51:48,697 --> 00:51:50,717
How desperate are you?

515
00:51:50,717 --> 00:51:54,271
You call on these lost
creatures to defend you.

516
00:51:54,306 --> 00:51:56,779
How desperate am I?

517
00:51:56,978 --> 00:51:58,732
You threaten my world with war.

518
00:51:58,732 --> 00:52:00,945
You steal a force you can't hope to control.

519
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:04,993
You talk about peace and you kill
cause it's fun.

520
00:52:05,193 --> 00:52:08,232
You have made me very desperate.

521
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:11,269
You might not be glad that you did.

522
00:52:13,638 --> 00:52:17,280
Ooh. It burns you to come so close.

523
00:52:18,315 --> 00:52:24,157
To have the Tesseract,
to have power, unlimited power.

524
00:52:24,357 --> 00:52:26,361
And for what?

525
00:52:27,931 --> 00:52:31,301
A world for all mankind to share,

526
00:52:31,968 --> 00:52:34,041
and then to be reminded what real power is.
Well let me know if real power...

527
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:36,325
...will want some magazine or something.

528
00:52:45,446 --> 00:52:50,483
- He really grows on you, doesn't he?
- Loki's gonna drag this out.

529
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:55,356
- So, Thor, what's his play?
- He has an army called the Chitauri,

530
00:52:55,556 --> 00:52:58,760
that none of Asgard nor any world know.

531
00:52:58,959 --> 00:53:02,831
He means to lead them against your people.
They will win him the earth.

532
00:53:03,032 --> 00:53:06,600
- Return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.
- An army,

533
00:53:06,804 --> 00:53:11,073
- from outer space.
- So he's building another portal.

534
00:53:11,297 --> 00:53:13,928
- That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.
- Selvig?

535
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:16,358
- He's an astrophysicist.
- He's a friend.

536
00:53:16,563 --> 00:53:19,330
Loki has him under some kind of spell,

537
00:53:19,532 --> 00:53:22,498
- along with one of ours.
- I wanna know why Loki let us take him.

538
00:53:22,703 --> 00:53:25,639
- He's not leading an army from here.
- I don't think we should be focusing on Loki.

539
00:53:25,841 --> 00:53:28,944
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats,
you could smell crazy on him.

540
00:53:29,149 --> 00:53:31,411
I don't care how you speak.

541
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:35,392
Loki is beyond reason,
but he is of Asgard, and he's my brother.

542
00:53:35,594 --> 00:53:38,125
He killed eighty people in two days.

543
00:53:38,327 --> 00:53:41,803
- He's adopted.
- I think its about the mechanics.

544
00:53:42,008 --> 00:53:46,123
- Iridium, what did they need the Iridium for?
- It's a stabilizing agent.

545
00:53:50,409 --> 00:53:54,423
Means the portal won't collapse
on itself, like it did at SHIELD.

546
00:53:54,626 --> 00:53:57,832
No hard feelings Point Break,
you've got a mean swing.

547
00:53:58,036 --> 00:54:03,467
Also, it means the portal can open as wide,
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.

548
00:54:07,385 --> 00:54:09,643
That man is playing gallaga.

549
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:13,964
Thought we wouldn't notice, but we did.

550
00:54:15,281 --> 00:54:18,014
- How does Fury even see these?
- He turns.

551
00:54:18,216 --> 00:54:20,240
Sounds exhausting.

552
00:54:20,846 --> 00:54:25,100
The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton
can get his hands on pretty easily.

553
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:28,307
Only major component he
still needs is a power source.

554
00:54:28,441 --> 00:54:33,942
A high energy density,
something to kick start the cube.

555
00:54:34,142 --> 00:54:37,181
When did you become an expert in
thermonuclear astrophysics?

556
00:54:37,383 --> 00:54:40,387
Last night.
The packet, Selvig's notes,

557
00:54:40,587 --> 00:54:43,356
the Extraction Theory papers.
Am I the only one who did the reading?

558
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:46,324
Does Loki need any particular
kind of power source?

559
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:48,570
He got to heat the cube to a hundred
and twenty million Kelvin

560
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:50,339
just to break through the Coulomb barrier.

561
00:54:50,339 --> 00:54:54,208
Unless, Selvig has figured out how to
stabilize the quantum tunnelling effect.

562
00:54:54,075 --> 00:54:58,104
Well, if he could do that he could achieve
Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet.

563
00:54:57,552 --> 00:54:59,916
Finally, someone who speaks English.

564
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:04,219
- Is that what just happened?
- It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.

565
00:55:04,423 --> 00:55:07,430
You're work on anti-electron
collisions is unparalleled.

566
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:10,630
And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control

567
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:12,686
and turn into an enormous green rage monster.

568
00:55:13,353 --> 00:55:16,965
- Thanks.
- Dr. Banner is only here to track the cube.

569
00:55:17,166 --> 00:55:19,773
- I was hoping you might join him.
- Let's start with that stick of his

570
00:55:20,974 --> 00:55:23,661
It may be magical, but it works an
awful lot like a Hydra weapon.

571
00:55:23,668 --> 00:55:26,456
I don't know about that,
but it is powered by the cube.

572
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,968
And I'd like to know how Loki used it to turn

573
00:55:28,968 --> 00:55:32,577
two of the sharpest men I know
into his personal flying monkeys.

574
00:55:32,611 --> 00:55:35,262
- Monkeys? I do not understand.
- I do.

575
00:55:37,538 --> 00:55:40,047
I understood that reference.

576
00:55:40,247 --> 00:55:43,427
- Shall we play it, Doctor?
- This way, Sir.

577
00:55:56,472 --> 00:55:59,674
The gamma readings are definitely consistent

578
00:55:59,674 --> 00:56:02,428
with Selvig's reports on the Tesseract.

579
00:56:01,577 --> 00:56:05,601
- But it's gonna take weeks to process.
- If we bypass their mainframe

580
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:09,879
and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster,
we can clock this around six hundred teraflops.

581
00:56:11,479 --> 00:56:13,018
All I packed was a tooth brush.

582
00:56:13,372 --> 00:56:15,947
You know, you should come
by Stark Towers sometime.

583
00:56:15,947 --> 00:56:18,465
Top ten floors, all R and D.

584
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:22,676
- You'd love it, it's candy land.
- Thanks, but the last time I was in New York, I...

585
00:56:22,711 --> 00:56:25,161
kind of broke Harlem.

586
00:56:25,477 --> 00:56:28,874
Well, I promise a stress
free environment. No tension.

587
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:30,169
No surprises.

588
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:33,958
- Nothing?
- Are you nuts?

589
00:56:33,994 --> 00:56:36,805
You really have got a lid on it,
haven't you? What's your secret?

590
00:56:36,841 --> 00:56:39,412
Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?

591
00:56:39,412 --> 00:56:40,716
Is everything a joke to you?

592
00:56:40,752 --> 00:56:44,755
Threatening the safety of everyone
on this ship isn't funny.

593
00:56:44,791 --> 00:56:46,581
No offense, Doctor.

594
00:56:46,581 --> 00:56:49,090
No, it....it's alright. I wouldn't
have come aboard if I couldn't

595
00:56:49,126 --> 00:56:53,331
- handle pointy things.
- You're tiptoeing, big man.

596
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:54,636
You need to strut.

597
00:56:54,348 --> 00:56:56,735
And you need to focus on
the problem, Mr. Stark.

598
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:59,894
You think I'm not?
Why did Fury call us and why now?

599
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:02,472
Why not before? What isn't he telling us.

600
00:57:02,696 --> 00:57:05,319
I can't do the equation unless
I have all the variables.

601
00:57:05,768 --> 00:57:07,898
- You think Fury's hiding something?
- He is a spy.

602
00:57:08,451 --> 00:57:11,904
He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy.
His secrets have secrets.

603
00:57:12,499 --> 00:57:13,921
It's bugging him too, isn't it?

604
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:19,664
- Uh, I just wanna finish my work here and...
- Doctor?

605
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:30,853
A world like for all mankind,
Loki's jab at Fury about the cube.

606
00:57:30,892 --> 00:57:33,571
- I heard it.
- Well, I think that was meant for you.

607
00:57:33,608 --> 00:57:38,405
Even if Barton didn't post
that all over the news.

608
00:57:38,441 --> 00:57:43,757
The Stark Tower? That big ugly......,
building in New York?

609
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:47,587
It's powered by Stark Reactors,
self sustaining energy source.

610
00:57:47,624 --> 00:57:50,642
That building will run itself
for what, a year?

611
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,455
That's just the prototype.

612
00:57:52,491 --> 00:57:55,298
I'm kind of the only name in
clean energy right now.

613
00:57:55,334 --> 00:58:00,165
So why didn't SHIELD bring him in
on the Tesseract project?

614
00:58:01,843 --> 00:58:05,112
I should probably look into that once
my decryption programme

615
00:58:05,112 --> 00:58:07,546
finishes breaking into all of SHIELD's secure files.

616
00:58:07,581 --> 00:58:10,246
- I'm sorry, did you say.....?
- Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge.

617
00:58:10,444 --> 00:58:13,379
In a few hours we'll know every dirty
secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide.

618
00:58:13,579 --> 00:58:16,311
- Blueberry? - Yet you're confused about
why they didn't want you around?

619
00:58:16,512 --> 00:58:19,961
An intelligence organization that fears intelligence?

620
00:58:19,961 --> 00:58:21,741
Historically not possible.

621
00:58:21,776 --> 00:58:23,449
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

622
00:58:23,648 --> 00:58:27,880
This is a man who means to start a war,
and if don't stay focused, he'll succeed.

623
00:58:28,081 --> 00:58:30,783
We have orders, we should follow them.

624
00:58:30,983 --> 00:58:33,582
Following is not really my style.

625
00:58:34,249 --> 00:58:36,615
And you're all about style, aren't you?

626
00:58:36,815 --> 00:58:40,917
Of the people in this room, which one is;
a-wearing a spangly outfit, and b- not of use?

627
00:58:41,118 --> 00:58:46,185
Steve, tell me none of this smells
a little funky to you?

628
00:58:48,385 --> 00:58:50,584
Just find the cube.

629
00:59:01,988 --> 00:59:04,220
That's the guy my dad never shut up about?

630
00:59:04,421 --> 00:59:07,353
Wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.

631
00:59:07,987 --> 00:59:11,556
The guy's not wrong about Loki,
he does have the jump on us.

632
00:59:11,757 --> 00:59:14,622
What he's got is an acme dynamite kit.

633
00:59:14,823 --> 00:59:18,887
It's gonna blow up in his face,
and I'm gonna be there when it does..

634
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:22,156
And I'll read all about it.

635
00:59:23,356 --> 00:59:25,987
Or you'll be suiting up like the rest of us.

636
00:59:26,191 --> 00:59:29,722
Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor.

637
00:59:29,925 --> 00:59:33,293
I'm exposed, like a nerve.

638
00:59:33,491 --> 00:59:37,256
- It's a nightmare.
- You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel,

639
00:59:37,461 --> 00:59:40,194
trying every second to crawl its way into my heart.

640
00:59:40,393 --> 00:59:43,928
This stops it. This little circle of light.

641
00:59:44,128 --> 00:59:47,727
It's part of me now, not just armor.

642
00:59:48,324 --> 00:59:52,595
- It's a terrible privilege.
- But you can control it.

643
00:59:52,794 --> 00:59:55,829
- Because I learned how.
- It's different.

644
00:59:56,262 --> 01:00:01,861
Hey, I've read all about your accident.
That much gammer exposure should have killed you.

645
01:00:02,062 --> 01:00:05,196
So you're saying that the Hulk,

646
01:00:05,861 --> 01:00:08,529
the other guy, saved my life?

647
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:12,029
That's nice.
It's a nice sentiment.

648
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:14,998
Save it for what?

649
01:00:15,733 --> 01:00:17,896
I guess we'll find out.

650
01:00:19,399 --> 01:00:23,165
- You may not enjoy that.
- You just might.

651
01:01:22,174 --> 01:01:25,307
As soon as Loki took the doctor we moved Jane Foster.

652
01:01:25,507 --> 01:01:28,768
We've got an excellent observatory in Traunsee.

653
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,831
She was asked to consult there
very suddenly yesterday.

654
01:01:31,866 --> 01:01:35,775
Handsome fee, private plane, very remote.

655
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:39,176
- She'll be safe.
- Thank you.

656
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:43,543
It's no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig.

657
01:01:43,744 --> 01:01:46,211
I dread what he plans for him once he's done.

658
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:49,778
- Erik is a good man.
- He talks about you a lot.

659
01:01:50,579 --> 01:01:53,178
You changed his life.

660
01:01:54,245 --> 01:01:58,481
- You changed everything around here.
- They were better as they were.

661
01:01:58,979 --> 01:02:01,879
We pretend on Asgard that
we're more advanced, but we.

662
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:04,712
We come here battling like Bilchsteim.

663
01:02:04,914 --> 01:02:10,548
- Like what?
- Bilchsteim. You know; huge, scaly, big antlers.

664
01:02:10,749 --> 01:02:12,514
- You don't have those?
- I don't think so.

665
01:02:12,717 --> 01:02:15,048
They are repulsive, and

666
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:19,048
they trample everything in their path.

667
01:02:25,782 --> 01:02:31,516
When I first came to earth, Loki's rage followed me
here and your people paid the price.

668
01:02:31,719 --> 01:02:34,252
And now again,

669
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:39,225
n my youth I courted war.

670
01:02:40,351 --> 01:02:42,884
War hasn't started yet.

671
01:02:43,587 --> 01:02:46,487
You think you can make Loki tell us what the Tesseract is?

672
01:02:46,686 --> 01:02:49,920
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield,

673
01:02:50,118 --> 01:02:54,520
it's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance upon me.

674
01:02:54,954 --> 01:02:57,887
There's no pain that would prise his need from him.

675
01:02:58,086 --> 01:03:02,923
A lot of guys think that, until the pain stops.

676
01:03:04,289 --> 01:03:09,290
- What are you asking me to do?
- I'm asking, what are you prepared to do?

677
01:03:09,491 --> 01:03:10,624
Loki is a prisoner.

678
01:03:10,755 --> 01:03:15,324
Then why do I feel like he's the only person on
this boat that wants to be here?

679
01:03:27,293 --> 01:03:30,293
There's not many people that can sneak up on me.

680
01:03:30,495 --> 01:03:35,092
But you figured I'd come after.

681
01:03:35,293 --> 01:03:38,461
After whatever tortures Fury can concoct,

682
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:42,495
you would appear as a friend,
as a balm.

683
01:03:43,463 --> 01:03:47,328
- And I would cooperate.
- I wanna know what you've done to Agent Barton.

684
01:03:47,495 --> 01:03:50,596
I'd say I've expanded his mind.

685
01:03:51,993 --> 01:03:56,999
And once you've won. Once you're king of the mountain.

686
01:03:58,064 --> 01:04:01,062
What happens to his mind?

687
01:04:01,896 --> 01:04:07,233
- Is this love, Agent Romanoff?
- Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

688
01:04:10,464 --> 01:04:12,465
Tell me.

689
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,867
Before I worked for SHIELD, I

690
01:04:23,733 --> 01:04:29,235
I made a name for myself.
I have a very specific skillset.

691
01:04:29,437 --> 01:04:33,870
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.

692
01:04:34,068 --> 01:04:37,402
I got on SHIELD's radar in a bad way.

693
01:04:38,672 --> 01:04:41,670
Agent Barton was sent to kill me,

694
01:04:42,669 --> 01:04:44,670
he made a different call.

695
01:04:46,877 --> 01:04:50,208
And what will you do if I vow to spare him?

696
01:04:50,478 --> 01:04:54,508
- I'll not let you out.
- Ah, no. But I like this

697
01:04:54,707 --> 01:04:58,107
Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man?

698
01:04:58,308 --> 01:05:02,839
Regime's fall everyday.
I tend not to weep over that, I'm Russian,

699
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:05,141
Or I was.

700
01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:10,269
- And what are you now?
- It's really not that complicated.

701
01:05:10,538 --> 01:05:14,873
I've got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out.

702
01:05:15,636 --> 01:05:17,637
Can you?

703
01:05:18,503 --> 01:05:21,837
Can you wipe out that much red?

704
01:05:23,504 --> 01:05:25,669
Drakoff's daughter?

705
01:05:26,601 --> 01:05:28,602
Sao Paulo?

706
01:05:29,534 --> 01:05:31,534
The hospital file?

707
01:05:32,801 --> 01:05:35,134
Barton told me everything.

708
01:05:35,332 --> 01:05:38,266
Your ledger is dripping, it's gushing red,

709
01:05:38,464 --> 01:05:42,497
and you think saving a man no more virtuous
than yourself will change anything?

710
01:05:42,697 --> 01:05:45,200
This is the basest sentimentality.

711
01:05:45,397 --> 01:05:49,496
This is a child at prayer.
Pathetic.

712
01:05:49,698 --> 01:05:52,429
You lie and kill

713
01:05:52,631 --> 01:05:56,328
in the service of liars and killers.

714
01:05:58,627 --> 01:06:01,861
You pretend to be separate,
to have your own code,

715
01:06:02,094 --> 01:06:04,761
something that makes up for the horrors.

716
01:06:05,726 --> 01:06:08,092
But they are a part of you,

717
01:06:08,294 --> 01:06:11,959
and they will never go away.

718
01:06:12,926 --> 01:06:16,090
I won't barter Barton! Not until I make him kill you.

719
01:06:16,291 --> 01:06:20,957
Slowly, intimately, in every way he knows you fear.

720
01:06:21,157 --> 01:06:24,121
And then he'll wake just long enough to see his good work,

721
01:06:24,324 --> 01:06:27,720
and when he screams I'll split his skull

722
01:06:27,923 --> 01:06:30,920
This is my bargain, you mewling quin!

723
01:06:32,587 --> 01:06:34,588
You're a monster.

724
01:06:36,387 --> 01:06:38,652
Oh, no.

725
01:06:38,853 --> 01:06:41,186
You brought the monster.

726
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:48,848
- So, Banner? That's your play?
- What?

727
01:06:49,049 --> 01:06:52,317
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.
Keep Banner in the lab, I'm on my way.

728
01:06:52,516 --> 01:06:54,514
Set the door locked.

729
01:06:55,451 --> 01:06:58,784
Thank you, for your cooperation.

730
01:07:09,405 --> 01:07:13,409
- What are you doing, Mr. Stark?
- kind of been wondering the same thing about you

731
01:07:13,610 --> 01:07:15,620
You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract.

732
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:18,710
We are, the model's locked and we're
sweeping for the signature now.

733
01:07:18,745 --> 01:07:21,782
When we get a hit, we'll have the
location within half a mile.

734
01:07:21,981 --> 01:07:25,649
And you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss.

735
01:07:26,317 --> 01:07:28,319
What is Phase 2?

736
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:32,489
Phase 2 is SHIELD used the cube to make weapons.

737
01:07:32,688 --> 01:07:34,788
Sorry, the computer was moving a little slow for me.

738
01:07:34,788 --> 01:07:38,033
Rogers, we gathered everything related
to the Tesseract.This does not...

739
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:41,426
- mean that we're.
- I'm sorry, Nick.
What were you lying?

740
01:07:42,394 --> 01:07:45,863
- I was wrong, Director. The world hasn't changed a bit.
- Do you know about this?

741
01:07:46,061 --> 01:07:48,772
You wanna think about removing yourself
from this environment, doctor?

742
01:07:48,772 --> 01:07:51,334
I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed.

743
01:07:51,369 --> 01:07:53,834
- Loki's manipulating you.
- And you've been doing what exactly?

744
01:07:54,032 --> 01:07:56,059
You didn't come here because
I bat my eyelashes at you.

745
01:07:56,059 --> 01:07:58,524
Yes, and I'm not leaving because
suddenly you get a little twitchy.

746
01:07:58,703 --> 01:08:04,406
I'd like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract
to build weapons of mass destruction.

747
01:08:04,838 --> 01:08:06,839
Because of him.

748
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:07,840
Me?

749
01:08:07,574 --> 01:08:11,512
Last year earth had a visitor
from another planet

750
01:08:11,709 --> 01:08:14,911
who had a grudge mass that levelled a small town.

751
01:08:15,114 --> 01:08:20,283
We learned that not only are we not alone,
but we are hopelessly, hilariously

752
01:08:20,483 --> 01:08:23,117
- out gunned.
- My people want nothing but peace with your planet.

753
01:08:23,318 --> 01:08:27,566
But you're not the only people out there, are you?
And, you're not the only threat.

754
01:08:27,769 --> 01:08:31,348
The world's filling up with people who can't be matched,

755
01:08:31,551 --> 01:08:33,858
- they can't be controlled.
- Like you controlled the cube?

756
01:08:34,059 --> 01:08:38,142
You're work with the Tesseract is
what drew Loki to it, and his allies.

757
01:08:38,343 --> 01:08:40,248
It is the signal to all the realms that the

758
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:42,192
earth is ready for a higher form of war.

759
01:08:42,394 --> 01:08:43,164
A higher form?

760
01:08:43,164 --> 01:08:46,227
You forced our hand.
We had to come up with something.

761
01:08:46,262 --> 01:08:49,087
A nuclear deterrent.
cause that always calms everything right down.

762
01:08:49,286 --> 01:08:51,661
Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark?

763
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:53,433
I'm sure if he still made weapons,
Stark would be neck deep...

764
01:08:53,433 --> 01:08:55,964
Wait, Wait, Hold on. How is this now about me?

765
01:08:56,112 --> 01:08:59,058
- I'm sorry, isn't everything?
- I thought humans were more evolved than this.

766
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:04,043
- Excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up?
- We can..

767
01:09:45,772 --> 01:09:49,657
- You speak of control, yet you court chaos.
- It's his M.O., isn't it?

768
01:09:49,857 --> 01:09:54,140
I mean, what are we, a team? No, no, no.
We're a chemical mixture that makes chaos.

769
01:09:54,341 --> 01:09:56,384
We're...we're a time-bomb.

770
01:09:56,582 --> 01:10:00,099
- You need to step away.
- Why shouldn't they guy let off a little steam?

771
01:10:00,299 --> 01:10:04,850
- You know damn well why! Back off!
- Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me.

772
01:10:05,051 --> 01:10:08,363
Yeah, big man in a suit of armor.

773
01:10:09,031 --> 01:10:13,317
- Take that off, what are you?
- Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.

774
01:10:13,516 --> 01:10:16,761
I know guys with none of that worth ten of you.

775
01:10:16,966 --> 01:10:21,315
I've seen the footage.
The only thing you really fight for is yourself.

776
01:10:21,515 --> 01:10:23,037
You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play,

777
01:10:23,037 --> 01:10:25,916
to lay down on a wire and let the
other guy crawl over you.

778
01:10:26,334 --> 01:10:28,510
I think I would just cut the wire.

779
01:10:31,152 --> 01:10:33,093
Always a way out.

780
01:10:33,564 --> 01:10:36,942
You know, you may not be a threat,
but you better stop pretending to be a hero

781
01:10:37,143 --> 01:10:39,420
A hero, like you?

782
01:10:39,621 --> 01:10:45,310
You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers.
Everything special about you came out of a bottle.

783
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:13,653
Put on the suite, let's go a few rounds.

784
01:11:14,591 --> 01:11:18,841
- You people are so petty, and tiny.
- Yes, right.

785
01:11:19,042 --> 01:11:21,171
Agent Romanoff, would you escort Dr.
Banner back to his...

786
01:11:21,171 --> 01:11:23,012
 Where? You're renting my room.

787
01:11:23,727 --> 01:11:26,770
- The cell was just...
- In case you needed to kill me.

788
01:11:26,973 --> 01:11:30,319
but you can't! I know, I tried.

789
01:11:32,595 --> 01:11:34,502
I got low,

790
01:11:34,704 --> 01:11:39,687
I didn't see an end, so I put a bullet in
my mouth and the other guy spit it out.

791
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:43,908
So I moved on, I focused on helping other people.

792
01:11:44,107 --> 01:11:47,488
I was good until you dragged me back into this freak show.

793
01:11:47,688 --> 01:11:49,898
and put everyone here at risk.
You wanna know my secret, Agent Romanoff?

794
01:11:49,898 --> 01:11:51,664
You wanna know how I stay calm?

795
01:11:55,789 --> 01:11:57,894
Dr. Banner.

796
01:11:57,553 --> 01:11:58,991
put down the scepter.

797
01:12:07,666 --> 01:12:09,774
Got it.

798
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,625
Sorry, kids. You don't get to see
my party trick after all.

799
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:17,936
Located the Tesseract?

800
01:12:17,971 --> 01:12:19,751
- I can get there faster.
- The Tesseract belongs on Asgard,

801
01:12:19,953 --> 01:12:21,664
- no human is a match for it.
- You're not going alone!

802
01:12:21,861 --> 01:12:23,268
You gonna stop me?
Put on the suit, let's find out.

803
01:12:23,469 --> 01:12:26,853
- I'm not afraid to hit an old man.
- Put on the suit.

804
01:12:28,893 --> 01:12:31,003
Oh, my God.

805
01:12:46,138 --> 01:12:48,514
- Put on the suit!
- Yep.

806
01:12:57,356 --> 01:13:01,071
- Hill!
- Its a detonation. Number three engines is down.

807
01:13:01,272 --> 01:13:03,481
-We're been hit.
-Fire engines.

808
01:13:03,681 --> 01:13:06,093
- Talk to me.
- Turbine looks mostly intact, -

809
01:13:06,293 --> 01:13:09,541
but it is impossible to get out there
and repair when we already there.

810
01:13:09,743 --> 01:13:12,251
If we lose one of engine we wont be.

811
01:13:12,453 --> 01:13:15,569
- Someone gonna get outside and patch the engine.
- Stark, did you capy that?

812
01:13:15,769 --> 01:13:19,854
- I'm on it.

813
01:13:25,812 --> 01:13:27,922
Okay.

814
01:13:29,932 --> 01:13:32,040
You okay right?

815
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:47,342
Keep that engine down.
Attention.wait the cameras going dark.

816
01:13:47,542 --> 01:13:49,652
Stay close.

817
01:13:50,892 --> 01:13:53,034
Level four.

818
01:13:53,235 --> 01:13:55,682
Engine three. I'll meet you there.

819
01:14:03,421 --> 01:14:05,528
Doctor.

820
01:14:06,935 --> 01:14:09,512
Bruce, you gotta fight.

821
01:14:09,708 --> 01:14:11,924
This is just what Loki wants.

822
01:14:13,278 --> 01:14:17,312
We're gonna be okay. Listen to me.

823
01:14:18,962 --> 01:14:20,946
We're gonna be okay. Right?

824
01:14:21,143 --> 01:14:23,584
I swear on my life I will get you out of this,

825
01:14:23,586 --> 01:14:25,406
you will walk away, and never...

826
01:14:25,605 --> 01:14:27,686
Your life?

827
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:46,422
Bruce.

828
01:15:21,879 --> 01:15:26,141
We have been carrying 180 to the south.
Takes us to the water.

829
01:15:26,338 --> 01:15:29,117
Free wind. Navigation
recalibration after the engine failure.

830
01:15:29,314 --> 01:15:32,252
- Is the sun coming up?
- Yes sir.

831
01:15:32,451 --> 01:15:35,825
Then put it on the left.
Takes us on the water.

832
01:15:36,022 --> 01:15:38,763
One more turbine goes down
we're trapped.

833
01:15:45,074 --> 01:15:47,157
Stark!

834
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:52,048
- Stark, I'm here!
- Good.

835
01:15:53,338 --> 01:15:55,319
See what we got.

836
01:15:55,516 --> 01:15:58,294
I gotta get this super conducting
cooling system back online

837
01:15:58,490 --> 01:16:02,257
before I can access the rotors and work
on dislodging the debris.

838
01:16:04,209 --> 01:16:08,572
I need you to get to that engine control panel
and tell me which relays are in overload position.

839
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,001
What's it look like in there?

840
01:16:24,234 --> 01:16:26,678
It seems to run on some form of electricity.

841
01:16:26,876 --> 01:16:28,958
Well, you're not wrong.

842
01:17:32,336 --> 01:17:35,212
We're not your enemies, Banner.

843
01:17:35,411 --> 01:17:37,623
Try to think.

844
01:17:46,382 --> 01:17:48,497
The relays are intact.

845
01:17:48,691 --> 01:17:51,104
- What's our next move?
- Even if I clear the rotors,

846
01:17:51,306 --> 01:17:53,385
this thing won't re-engage without a jump.

847
01:17:53,082 --> 01:17:54,192
I'm gonna have to get in there and push.

848
01:17:54,192 --> 01:17:56,468
Well if that thing gets up to speed,
you'll get shredded.

849
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:59,366
Then stay in the control unit and reverse
polarity long enough to disengage mag..

850
01:17:59,567 --> 01:18:02,673
Speak English.

851
01:18:03,367 --> 01:18:05,479
See that red lever?

852
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:07,795
It'll slow the rotors down long
enough for me to get out.

853
01:18:07,989 --> 01:18:10,601
Stand by it, wait for my word.

854
01:19:02,187 --> 01:19:04,826
I need full evac on lower deck.

855
01:19:07,505 --> 01:19:09,585
Grenade.

856
01:19:23,367 --> 01:19:26,835
We gotta perimeter breach.
Hostile wiped SHIELD gear.

857
01:19:36,681 --> 01:19:40,317
Hulk and Thor are in the research level
4, level 2 and 3.

858
01:19:40,516 --> 01:19:43,059
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!

859
01:19:44,084 --> 01:19:49,043
- Get his attention.
- Escorts, Six o proceed to the.

860
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:52,080
- Don't get too close.

861
01:20:03,778 --> 01:20:05,859
Target acquired.

862
01:20:09,925 --> 01:20:12,006
Target engaged.

863
01:20:22,416 --> 01:20:24,927
Target in moving.

864
01:21:52,792 --> 01:21:55,499
Engine now all shut down.

865
01:22:05,846 --> 01:22:08,024
Sir we lost all engine one.

866
01:22:08,222 --> 01:22:12,586
It's Barton. He took out our system.
He's headed for the detention lab.

867
01:22:12,784 --> 01:22:14,766
Does anybody copy?

868
01:22:15,924 --> 01:22:19,788
This is Agent Romanoff.I copy.

869
01:22:24,151 --> 01:22:27,454
- Stark,we losing altitude.
- I have noticed.

870
01:22:55,675 --> 01:22:57,688
No!

871
01:23:04,398 --> 01:23:07,672
Are you ever not going to fall for that?

872
01:23:49,934 --> 01:23:55,549
The humans think us immortal. Should we test that?

873
01:23:57,665 --> 01:23:59,714
Move away please.

874
01:24:03,283 --> 01:24:05,629
Do you like this?

875
01:24:05,825 --> 01:24:09,593
We started working on the prototype
after you sent The Destroyer.

876
01:24:10,255 --> 01:24:12,702
Even I don't know what it does.

877
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:15,412
Do you wanna find out?

878
01:24:16,566 --> 01:24:18,615
No!

879
01:25:27,511 --> 01:25:29,593
Natasha ...

880
01:26:00,524 --> 01:26:02,637
You're gonna lose.

881
01:26:04,356 --> 01:26:06,471
Am I?

882
01:26:06,866 --> 01:26:09,248
It's in your nature.

883
01:26:11,524 --> 01:26:17,443
You're heroes are scattered,
your floating fortress falls from the sky.

884
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:22,533
- Where is my disadvantage?
- Your lack conviction.

885
01:26:23,191 --> 01:26:25,208
I don't think I...

886
01:26:30,891 --> 01:26:33,170
So that's what it does.

887
01:27:05,422 --> 01:27:08,628
- Cap, need a lever.
- I need a minute here!

888
01:27:09,421 --> 01:27:12,593
Lever, now!

889
01:28:00,343 --> 01:28:03,811
I'm sorry, boss. They got rabbited.

890
01:28:04,007 --> 01:28:06,854
Just stay awake. Eyes on me

891
01:28:07,050 --> 01:28:10,652
- No, I'm clockin' out here
- Not an option.

892
01:28:11,314 --> 01:28:14,123
It's okay, boss.

893
01:28:15,114 --> 01:28:21,027
This was never gonna work if they
didn't have something to.....

894
01:28:51,154 --> 01:28:53,809
Agent Coulson is down.

895
01:28:54,407 --> 01:28:58,291
- The medical team on the way to the location.
- They're here.

896
01:29:19,035 --> 01:29:21,657
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

897
01:29:23,814 --> 01:29:27,230
Guess he never did get you to sign them.

898
01:29:29,489 --> 01:29:34,434
We're dead in the air up here.
Our communications, location of the cube,

899
01:29:34,732 --> 01:29:40,208
Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you.

900
01:29:40,507 --> 01:29:43,660
Lost my one good eye.

901
01:29:46,152 --> 01:29:48,540
Maybe I had that coming.

902
01:29:53,650 --> 01:29:55,678
Yes.

903
01:29:55,974 --> 01:29:59,889
We were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract.

904
01:29:59,952 --> 01:30:02,656
I never put all my chips on that number though,

905
01:30:02,656 --> 01:30:04,578
because I was playing something even riskier.

906
01:30:08,781 --> 01:30:13,126
There was an idea, Stark knows this,

907
01:30:14,954 --> 01:30:18,274
called The Avengers Initiative.

908
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:24,144
The idea was to bring together
a group of remarkable people,

909
01:30:25,042 --> 01:30:27,996
see if they could become something more.

910
01:30:29,293 --> 01:30:32,810
See if they could work together when we needed them to,

911
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:36,260
to fight the battles that we never could.

912
01:30:39,746 --> 01:30:44,358
Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea,

913
01:30:46,614 --> 01:30:48,972
in heroes.

914
01:30:57,060 --> 01:31:02,017
Well, it's an old fashioned notion.

915
01:31:22,963 --> 01:31:25,784
You fell out of the sky.

916
01:31:39,523 --> 01:31:44,104
- Did I hurt anybody?
- There's nobody around here to get hurt.

917
01:31:44,470 --> 01:31:47,291
You did scare the hell out of some pigeons though.

918
01:31:47,818 --> 01:31:50,505
- Lucky.
- Or just good aim.

919
01:31:50,738 --> 01:31:53,193
You were awake when you fell.

920
01:31:54,155 --> 01:31:57,775
- You saw?
- The whole thing, right through the ceiling.

921
01:31:58,073 --> 01:32:02,120
Big and green and buck ass nude.

922
01:32:02,354 --> 01:32:04,311
Here...

923
01:32:04,611 --> 01:32:09,092
I didn't think those would fit you until
you shrunk down to a regular size fella.

924
01:32:11,447 --> 01:32:13,505
Thank you.

925
01:32:13,801 --> 01:32:16,523
- Are you an alien?
- What?

926
01:32:16,884 --> 01:32:20,234
- From outer space, an alien?
- No.

927
01:32:20,534 --> 01:32:24,246
Well then, son. You've got a condition.

928
01:32:34,158 --> 01:32:37,213
Clint, You're gonna be alright.

929
01:32:39,799 --> 01:32:44,639
You know that? Is that what you know?

930
01:32:46,826 --> 01:32:50,541
I got...I gotta go in though.

931
01:32:50,704 --> 01:32:52,597
I gotta flush him out.

932
01:32:52,795 --> 01:32:55,343
We don't have that long, it's gonna take time.

933
01:32:55,343 --> 01:32:56,632
I don't understand.

934
01:32:58,266 --> 01:33:01,583
Have you ever had someone take your brain and play?

935
01:33:02,476 --> 01:33:06,191
Pull you out and send something else in?

936
01:33:09,575 --> 01:33:11,795
Do you know what it's like to be unmade?

937
01:33:13,486 --> 01:33:15,906
You know that I do.

938
01:33:23,432 --> 01:33:27,114
Why am I back? How did you get him out?

939
01:33:27,312 --> 01:33:29,767
Cognitive recalibration.

940
01:33:29,965 --> 01:33:32,551
I hit you really hard in the head.

941
01:33:33,181 --> 01:33:35,535
Thanks.

942
01:33:38,090 --> 01:33:40,079
Natasha,

943
01:33:40,675 --> 01:33:45,583
- how many agents?
- Don't. Don't do that to yourself, Clint.

944
01:33:46,110 --> 01:33:47,904
This is Loki.

945
01:33:48,037 --> 01:33:52,841
This is monsters and magic and
nothing we were ever trained for.

946
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:57,388
- Loki, he got away?
- Yeah. I don't suppose you know where?

947
01:33:57,586 --> 01:34:01,728
I didn't need to know. I didn't ask.

948
01:34:05,714 --> 01:34:09,592
He's gonna make his play soon though. Today.

949
01:34:09,793 --> 01:34:12,677
- We gotta stop him.
- Yeah? Who's we?

950
01:34:12,877 --> 01:34:15,495
I don't know. Who's ever left.

951
01:34:18,977 --> 01:34:23,784
Well, if I put an arrow in Loki's eye socket,
I'd sleep better I suppose.

952
01:34:26,967 --> 01:34:28,957
Now you sound like you.

953
01:34:29,257 --> 01:34:31,279
But you don't.

954
01:34:32,570 --> 01:34:35,422
You're a spy, not a soldier.

955
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:40,162
Now you want to wade into a war. Why?

956
01:34:42,021 --> 01:34:44,142
What did Loki do to you?

957
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:47,459
He didn't, I just...

958
01:34:50,742 --> 01:34:52,797
Natasha.

959
01:34:54,356 --> 01:34:58,269
I've been compromised.

960
01:34:59,463 --> 01:35:02,214
I got red in my ledger,

961
01:35:03,606 --> 01:35:05,862
I'd like to wipe it out.

962
01:35:21,809 --> 01:35:24,498
- Was he married?
- No

963
01:35:24,959 --> 01:35:29,404
He was a...cellist, I think.

964
01:35:30,662 --> 01:35:34,608
I'm sorry. He seemed like a good man.

965
01:35:35,804 --> 01:35:38,986
- He was an idiot.
- Why? For believing?

966
01:35:39,184 --> 01:35:42,502
- For taking on Loki alone.
- He was doing his job.

967
01:35:42,799 --> 01:35:45,384
He was out of his league.
He should have waited.

968
01:35:45,835 --> 01:35:46,680
He should have...

969
01:35:46,746 --> 01:35:50,259
- Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.
- Right. How did that work for him?

970
01:35:50,527 --> 01:35:54,503
- Is this the first time you've lost a soldier?
- We're not soldiers!

971
01:35:58,352 --> 01:36:01,169
- I'm not marching to Fury's fife.
- Neither am I.

972
01:36:01,333 --> 01:36:03,587
He's got the same blood on his hands that Loki does,

973
01:36:03,886 --> 01:36:07,006
but right now we gotta put
that behind us and get this done.

974
01:36:07,302 --> 01:36:09,172
Now Loki needs a power source,

975
01:36:09,172 --> 01:36:11,124
- if we can put together a list...
- He made it personal.

976
01:36:11,159 --> 01:36:14,534
- That's not the point.
- That is the point. That's Loki's point.

977
01:36:14,697 --> 01:36:17,614
- He hit us all right where we live. Why?
- To tear us apart.

978
01:36:17,747 --> 01:36:22,190
He had to conquer his greed,
but he knows he has to take us out to win, right?

979
01:36:22,321 --> 01:36:26,203
That's what he wants. He wants to beat us,
he wants to be seen doing it.

980
01:36:26,501 --> 01:36:30,481
- He wants an audience.
- Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.

981
01:36:30,876 --> 01:36:35,852
Yeah. That's just previews, this is...
this is opening night. And Loki, he's a full-tail diva.

982
01:36:36,147 --> 01:36:38,324
He wants flowers, he wants parades,

983
01:36:38,324 --> 01:36:41,257
he wants a monument built to
the skies with his name plastered.

984
01:36:43,147 --> 01:36:45,136
I hope that would be true.

985
01:36:55,746 --> 01:36:57,567
- Time to go.
- Go where?

986
01:36:57,702 --> 01:37:00,257
I'll tell you on the way. Can you fly one of those jets?

987
01:37:01,151 --> 01:37:03,174
I can.

988
01:37:06,423 --> 01:37:09,904
You got a suit? Yeah.
Then suit up.

989
01:37:37,291 --> 01:37:41,602
- You guys aren't authorized to be in here.
- Son, just don't.

990
01:37:44,084 --> 01:37:46,093
Sir.

991
01:37:46,094 --> 01:37:47,098
Done is jacket.

992
01:37:51,070 --> 01:37:53,410
They needed to push.

993
01:37:58,702 --> 01:38:04,526
They found it. Get our communications back up
whatever you have to do.

994
01:38:04,895 --> 01:38:08,244
- I want eyes on everything.
- Yes sir.

995
01:38:23,543 --> 01:38:26,320
This device has already self sustainig.

996
01:38:26,456 --> 01:38:31,509
- Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.
- It's too late.

997
01:38:32,849 --> 01:38:37,536
It can't stop now.
He wants to show us something!

998
01:38:37,906 --> 01:38:41,788
- A new universe.
- Okay.

999
01:38:48,653 --> 01:38:52,469
The barrier is pure energy. It's unbreachable.

1000
01:38:52,637 --> 01:38:54,809
Yeah I get that.

1001
01:38:55,649 --> 01:38:57,657
Plan B.

1002
01:38:57,825 --> 01:39:00,533
Sir, mark 7 is not ready for deployment.

1003
01:39:00,533 --> 01:39:02,180
Then skip the spinning ring.We're run out of clock.

1004
01:39:21,962 --> 01:39:25,309
Please tell me you're going to
appeal to my humanity.

1005
01:39:28,667 --> 01:39:32,896
- Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten.
- You should have left your armor on for that.

1006
01:39:32,909 --> 01:39:37,791
Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage.
You've got the blue stick of destiny.

1007
01:39:40,812 --> 01:39:44,063
- Stalling me won't change anything.
- No, no, no! Threatening.

1008
01:39:48,538 --> 01:39:52,921
The Chitauri are coming, nothing will change that.

1009
01:39:53,459 --> 01:39:56,806
- What have I to fear?
- The Avengers.

1010
01:39:58,679 --> 01:40:01,498
It's what we call ourselves, sort of like a team.

1011
01:40:01,498 --> 01:40:03,697
Earth's Mightiest Heroes type of thing.

1012
01:40:03,732 --> 01:40:05,412
Yes, I've met them.

1013
01:40:05,412 --> 01:40:08,845
Yeah, takes us a while to get any traction,
I'll give you that one.

1014
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:13,370
But, let's do a head count here.
Your brother, the demi-God

1015
01:40:15,079 --> 01:40:18,693
a super soldier, a living legend
who kind of lives up to the legend

1016
01:40:18,861 --> 01:40:22,073
a man with breath-taking anger management issues

1017
01:40:22,243 --> 01:40:25,753
a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella

1018
01:40:25,891 --> 01:40:28,768
you've managed to piss off every single one of them.

1019
01:40:28,934 --> 01:40:31,882
- That was the plan.
- Not a great plan.

1020
01:40:32,013 --> 01:40:37,266
When they come, and they will, they'll come for you.

1021
01:40:37,404 --> 01:40:39,846
- I have an army.
- We have a Hulk.

1022
01:40:39,977 --> 01:40:43,525
-I thought the beast had wandered off.
-You're missing the point. There's no throne,

1023
01:40:43,662 --> 01:40:47,373
there is no version of this, where you come out on top.

1024
01:40:47,845 --> 01:40:52,394
Maybe your army comes and
maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you.

1025
01:40:52,897 --> 01:40:57,148
Because if we can't protect the Earth,
you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it.

1026
01:40:59,088 --> 01:41:02,166
How will your friends have time for me,

1027
01:41:02,335 --> 01:41:05,010
when they're so busy fighting you?

1028
01:41:11,638 --> 01:41:16,526
- It should work!
- Well, performance issues. You know?

1029
01:41:18,970 --> 01:41:22,181
Jarvis, anytime now.

1030
01:41:23,756 --> 01:41:27,974
- You will all fall before me.

1031
01:41:56,888 --> 01:42:00,603
And there's one other person you pissed off!

1032
01:42:01,069 --> 01:42:03,249
His name is Phil.

1033
01:42:26,271 --> 01:42:29,986
Right.
Army.

1034
01:43:41,474 --> 01:43:46,091
Loki, turn off the Tesseract or I'll destroy it!
You can't.

1035
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:48,103
There is no stopping it.

1036
01:43:48,268 --> 01:43:52,651
- There is only the war!
- So be it.

1037
01:44:14,546 --> 01:44:18,261
- Stark, we're heading north east.
- What, did you stop for drive-through?

1038
01:44:18,395 --> 01:44:21,775
Swing that park, I'm gonna lay them out for you.

1039
01:44:38,342 --> 01:44:42,728
- So we have more incoming.
- Lets keep them occupied.

1040
01:44:48,585 --> 01:44:51,964
- Nat.
- Did you see them?

1041
01:45:34,802 --> 01:45:37,480
We need back up there.

1042
01:46:30,506 --> 01:46:35,156
- Stark, are you seeing this?
- I'm seeing, still working on believing..

1043
01:46:35,357 --> 01:46:37,936
- Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?
- Banner?

1044
01:46:38,138 --> 01:46:42,653
Just keep me posted.
Jarvis, find me a soft spot.

1045
01:46:44,667 --> 01:46:48,379
Look at this. Look around you.

1046
01:46:48,583 --> 01:46:52,194
You think this madness will end with your rule?

1047
01:46:52,395 --> 01:46:56,813
It's too late. It's too late to stop it.

1048
01:46:57,012 --> 01:47:01,095
No. We can, together.

1049
01:47:07,489 --> 01:47:09,497
Sentiment!

1050
01:47:37,301 --> 01:47:39,576
You got civilian trap in the roof.

1051
01:47:40,815 --> 01:47:42,822
Loki.

1052
01:47:53,163 --> 01:47:55,607
There more down there.

1053
01:48:00,656 --> 01:48:04,374
- We got this. Go Go.
- You think you can hold them off?

1054
01:48:04,541 --> 01:48:06,547
Captain,

1055
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:09,660
it would be my genuine pleasure.

1056
01:48:37,100 --> 01:48:38,267
Just like Budapest all over again!

1057
01:48:38,267 --> 01:48:41,019
You and I remember Budapest very differently.

1058
01:49:00,657 --> 01:49:02,665
National guard?

1059
01:49:03,467 --> 01:49:05,506
Does the army know what's happening here?

1060
01:49:05,710 --> 01:49:07,280
Do we?

1061
01:49:06,984 --> 01:49:08,025
I need men in these buildings.

1062
01:49:08,119 --> 01:49:10,526
There are people inside that
can run into the line of fire.

1063
01:49:11,764 --> 01:49:13,205
You take them through the
basement or through the subway,

1064
01:49:13,205 --> 01:49:14,546
you keep them off the streets.

1065
01:49:15,581 --> 01:49:20,932
- I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.
- Why the hell should I take orders from you?

1066
01:49:33,849 --> 01:49:37,262
I need men in those buildings,
lead the people down and away from the streets

1067
01:49:37,464 --> 01:49:40,810
I wanna shut off the perimeter
all the way down of 39 Street.

1068
01:49:50,246 --> 01:49:54,263
Well, we got its attention.
Where it heads to?

1069
01:50:22,582 --> 01:50:25,696
- Lets Thor hear what says.
- The powers surrounding the cube is impenetrable

1070
01:50:25,893 --> 01:50:28,233
Thor is right, we gotta deal with these guys.

1071
01:50:28,434 --> 01:50:32,078
- How do we do this? As a team.
- I have unfinished business with Loki.

1072
01:50:32,279 --> 01:50:34,417
- Yeah, get in line.
- Save it.

1073
01:50:33,975 --> 01:50:38,113
Save it. Loki's gonna keep this fight focused on us and that's
what we need. Without him these things could run wild.

1074
01:50:38,314 --> 01:50:41,508
We got Stark up top, he's gonna need us...

1075
01:50:48,804 --> 01:50:52,838
So, this all seems horrible.

1076
01:50:53,174 --> 01:50:55,663
- I've seen worse.
- Sorry.

1077
01:50:55,862 --> 01:50:58,822
No, we could use a little worse.

1078
01:50:59,024 --> 01:51:01,377
- Stark, we got him,
- Banne.

1079
01:51:01,579 --> 01:51:06,958
-  just like you said.
- Tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you.

1080
01:51:12,270 --> 01:51:15,164
I don't see how that's a party.

1081
01:51:22,291 --> 01:51:24,306
Dr. Banner,

1082
01:51:24,982 --> 01:51:27,502
Dr. Banner, now might be a good time for you to get angry.

1083
01:51:27,704 --> 01:51:30,258
That's my secret, Captain.

1084
01:51:31,941 --> 01:51:33,960
I'm always angry.

1085
01:51:45,154 --> 01:51:47,173
Hold on.

1086
01:52:16,218 --> 01:52:18,567
Send the rest.

1087
01:52:24,689 --> 01:52:27,989
Guys.
- Call it, Captain.

1088
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:28,184
Alright, listen up.

1089
01:52:28,184 --> 01:52:31,038
Until we can close that portal up there,
we're gonna use containment.

1090
01:52:31,558 --> 01:52:34,004
Barton, I want you on that roof, eyes on everything.

1091
01:52:34,004 --> 01:52:35,168
Call out patterns and strays.

1092
01:52:35,203 --> 01:52:36,542
Stark, you got the perimeter.

1093
01:52:36,542 --> 01:52:39,677
Anything gets more than three blocks out,
you turn it back or your turn it to ash.

1094
01:52:39,712 --> 01:52:43,322
- Wanna give me a lift?
- Right. Better clench up, Legoolas.

1095
01:52:45,697 --> 01:52:49,237
Thor, you've gotta try and bottleneck
that portal, slow them down.

1096
01:52:49,437 --> 01:52:52,779
You've got the lightning, light the bastards up.

1097
01:52:54,181 --> 01:52:57,152
You and me, we stay here on the
ground, keep the fighting here.

1098
01:52:57,251 --> 01:52:57,828
And Hulk,

1099
01:52:59,254 --> 01:53:02,243
Smash.

1100
01:53:54,306 --> 01:53:56,127
Sir.

1101
01:54:02,172 --> 01:54:06,153
Stark, you have a lot of
Strand out here.

1102
01:54:07,114 --> 01:54:11,757
- I try to keep them off the streets.
- But they cant bang with the them.

1103
01:54:11,954 --> 01:54:15,272
- Find the ....
- I will roger that.

1104
01:54:37,596 --> 01:54:39,584
Oh, boy.

1105
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:48,473
Nice call, what else do you got?

1106
01:54:48,670 --> 01:54:51,624
We force taking out the squadron on 6.

1107
01:54:51,823 --> 01:54:54,509
And it didn't invite me.

1108
01:55:33,713 --> 01:55:36,565
Captain, none of this is gonna mean a
damn thing if we don't close that portal.

1109
01:55:36,767 --> 01:55:40,676
- Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.
- Well, maybe it's not about guns

1110
01:55:42,799 --> 01:55:45,454
You wanna get up there,
you're gonna need a ride.

1111
01:55:47,974 --> 01:55:50,099
I could use a boost though.

1112
01:55:51,889 --> 01:55:55,868
- You sure about this?
- Yeah, it's gonna be fun.

1113
01:56:22,669 --> 01:56:25,122
Turn, turn.

1114
01:57:42,201 --> 01:57:44,226
This way.

1115
01:58:47,841 --> 01:58:51,055
Director Fury, the council has made a decision.

1116
01:58:51,251 --> 01:58:54,170
I recognize the council has made a decision,

1117
01:58:54,364 --> 01:58:57,416
but given that it's a stupid assed decision,
I've elected to ignore it.

1118
01:58:57,614 --> 01:59:02,183
Director, you're closer than any of our subs,
you scramble that jet

1119
01:59:02,381 --> 01:59:05,164
That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman.

1120
01:59:05,363 --> 01:59:08,216
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,

1121
01:59:08,217 --> 01:59:10,794
I will not order a nuclear strike
against a civilian population.

1122
01:59:10,993 --> 01:59:13,312
If we don't hold them in the air,
we lose everything.

1123
01:59:13,511 --> 01:59:16,491
I'd send that bird out, we already have.

1124
01:59:23,974 --> 01:59:25,997
Hawkeye.

1125
01:59:26,559 --> 01:59:30,401
- Nat, what are you doing?
- Little help.

1126
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:37,028
I got him.

1127
02:00:02,526 --> 02:00:06,105
Enough!
You are all of you beneath me!

1128
02:00:06,305 --> 02:00:11,275
I am God, you dull creature,
and I will not be bullied by.

1129
02:00:20,348 --> 02:00:22,334
Puny God.

1130
02:00:33,162 --> 02:00:34,200
Doctor.

1131
02:00:36,012 --> 02:00:40,944
Loki's scepter, the energy...
the Tesseract can't fight.

1132
02:00:41,324 --> 02:00:43,098
You can't protect against yourself.

1133
02:00:44,332 --> 02:00:47,306
It's not your fault. You didn't know what you were doing.

1134
02:00:49,747 --> 02:00:51,860
Well, actually I think I did.

1135
02:00:52,058 --> 02:00:55,194
I built in a safety to cut the power source.

1136
02:00:56,217 --> 02:01:00,508
- Loki's scepter.
- It may be able to close the portal.

1137
02:01:02,556 --> 02:01:04,540
And I'm looking right at it.

1138
02:01:16,455 --> 02:01:20,415
Sir, we're losing power before penetrate that shell.

1139
02:01:27,051 --> 02:01:30,353
JARVIS, you hear
the Tell of Jonah?

1140
02:01:30,551 --> 02:01:33,193
I'm considering be a role model.

1141
02:02:41,380 --> 02:02:45,408
Director of Fury no longer responsible.
overwrite order 7-Alfa-1-1.

1142
02:02:45,607 --> 02:02:48,576
7-Alfa 1-1-confirmed.
We are about to take off.

1143
02:02:49,039 --> 02:02:51,282
Sir we have born in motion.

1144
02:02:51,482 --> 02:02:53,462
Anyone on the deck?

1145
02:02:53,662 --> 02:02:57,621
We need to shut it down.
I repeat, take off is not authorized.

1146
02:03:27,301 --> 02:03:29,249
Stark, do you hear me?

1147
02:03:29,611 --> 02:03:31,987
We have a missile headed straight for the city.

1148
02:03:32,184 --> 02:03:35,616
- How long?
- Three minutes, at best.

1149
02:03:35,818 --> 02:03:37,798
Stay load and wipe out them.

1150
02:03:37,962 --> 02:03:41,529
- Jarvis, put anything we got it.
- I just did.

1151
02:03:54,534 --> 02:03:59,688
The package is set. detonation in two
minutes and thirty seconds from now.

1152
02:04:21,870 --> 02:04:23,852
You ready for another bout?

1153
02:04:24,976 --> 02:04:26,990
What, you gettin' sleepy?

1154
02:04:31,544 --> 02:04:33,525
Right of to the front.

1155
02:04:39,560 --> 02:04:43,303
I can close it! Can anybody copy?

1156
02:04:43,539 --> 02:04:45,755
- I can shut the portal down!
- Do it!

1157
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:48,273
- No, wait!
- Stark, these things are still coming!

1158
02:04:48,438 --> 02:04:51,486
I got a nuke coming in,
it's gonna blow in less than a minute.

1159
02:05:01,324 --> 02:05:03,742
And I know just where to put it.

1160
02:05:09,971 --> 02:05:13,919
Stark, you know that's a one way trip.
- Save the rest for the turn jarvs.

1161
02:05:13,977 --> 02:05:19,906
- Shall I tray Miss Potts?
- Where her?

1162
02:05:22,256 --> 02:05:24,809
New York streets
has become a battleground.

1163
02:05:24,973 --> 02:05:30,275
The army is here, and try to contain
violence, but clearly

1164
02:05:36,667 --> 02:05:40,840
But the billionaire
Iron Man, Tony Stark ...

1165
02:06:51,987 --> 02:06:54,009
Come on, Stark.

1166
02:07:00,233 --> 02:07:02,222
Close it.

1167
02:07:21,438 --> 02:07:23,421
Son of a guy.

1168
02:07:27,329 --> 02:07:29,518
He's not slowing down.

1169
02:08:16,392 --> 02:08:18,377
What the hell?

1170
02:08:20,463 --> 02:08:24,602
What just happened?
Please tell me nobody kissed me?

1171
02:08:29,309 --> 02:08:31,294
We won.

1172
02:08:33,250 --> 02:08:36,593
Alright. Hey. Alright. Good job

1173
02:08:36,763 --> 02:08:40,670
guys. Let's just not come in tomorrow.

1174
02:08:40,969 --> 02:08:43,449
Let's just take a day.
Have you ever tried shawarma?

1175
02:08:43,449 --> 02:08:46,638
There's a shawarma joint
about two blocks from here.

1176
02:08:46,673 --> 02:08:48,138
I don't know what it is, but I wanna try it.

1177
02:08:48,138 --> 02:08:50,106
We're not finished yet.

1178
02:08:53,788 --> 02:08:55,776
And then shawarma after.

1179
02:09:18,408 --> 02:09:20,596
If it's all the same to you,

1180
02:09:24,008 --> 02:09:26,029
I'll have that drink now.

1181
02:09:33,546 --> 02:09:36,322
This point of devastation
what has been confirmed...

1182
02:09:36,322 --> 02:09:40,057
...as extra terrestrial attack
be a extraordinary a heroic group

1183
02:09:40,194 --> 02:09:42,122
...known as The Avengers has been.....

1184
02:09:48,925 --> 02:09:50,441
I love you, Thor!

1185
02:10:03,802 --> 02:10:07,057
Super hero in New York?
Give me a break!

1186
02:10:06,713 --> 02:10:09,108
These so called heroes have to be held responsible

1187
02:10:09,108 --> 02:10:10,678
for the destruction done to the city.

1188
02:10:12,860 --> 02:10:14,648
This was their fight. Where are they now?

1189
02:10:23,963 --> 02:10:27,185
Captain America saved my life.

1190
02:10:29,035 --> 02:10:33,979
Whatever he is
and whatever any of them are i just

1191
02:10:34,717 --> 02:10:37,750
just want a say thank you.

1192
02:10:39,632 --> 02:10:39,914
- Where are the Avengers?
- I'm not currently tracking their whereabouts.

1193
02:10:44,140 --> 02:10:46,289
I'd say they'd earned a leave of absence.

1194
02:10:46,496 --> 02:10:49,712
- And the Tesseract?
- The Tesseract is where it belongs,

1195
02:10:51,032 --> 02:10:53,135
Out of our reach.

1196
02:10:53,117 --> 02:10:54,841
That's not your call.

1197
02:10:54,685 --> 02:10:55,901
I didn't make it.

1198
02:10:56,234 --> 02:11:02,174
So you let him take it and the war criminal, Loki,

1199
02:11:02,174 --> 02:11:03,990
who should be answering for his crime.

1200
02:11:04,190 --> 02:11:06,392
Oh, I think he will be.

1201
02:11:20,037 --> 02:11:22,660
I don't think you understand what you've started,

1202
02:11:22,695 --> 02:11:25,026
letting in The Avengers loose on some this world.

1203
02:11:25,466 --> 02:11:28,561
- They dangerous.
- They surely are,

1204
02:11:28,905 --> 02:11:33,455
and the whole world knows it. Every world knows it.

1205
02:11:33,490 --> 02:11:37,668
Was that the point in all this? A statement.

1206
02:11:38,738 --> 02:11:41,789
A promise.

1207
02:11:51,561 --> 02:11:52,614
How does it work now?

1208
02:11:53,262 --> 02:11:57,924
They've gone their separate ways,
some pretty extremely far.

1209
02:11:58,757 --> 02:12:02,638
We get into a situation like this again,
what happens then?

1210
02:12:03,598 --> 02:12:04,423
They'll come back.

1211
02:12:05,887 --> 02:12:08,363
- Are you really sure about that?
- I am.

1212
02:12:08,947 --> 02:12:14,350
- Why?
- Because we'll need them to.
