1
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,192
On your left.

2
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,100
On your left.

3
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,232
<i>Uh-huh. On my left. Got it.</i>

4
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:11,380
Don't say it. Don't you say it.

5
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,008
- On your left.
- Come on!

6
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,850
Oh!

7
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:23,418
Need a medic?

8
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,860
I need a new set of lungs.

9
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,266
Dude, you just ran,
like, 13 miles in 30 minutes.

10
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:32,438
I guess I got a late start.

11
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,073
Really? You should
be ashamed of yourself.

12
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,775
You should take another lap.

13
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:40,036
Did you just take it?
I assume you just took it.

14
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,775
What unit you with?

15
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,312
58th Pararescue.

16
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,039
But now I'm working down at the VA.

17
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,376
- Sam Wilson.
- Steve Rogers.

18
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,714
I kind of put that together.

19
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:53,314
Must have freaked you out, coming
home after the whole defrosting thing.

20
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,893
It takes some getting used to.

21
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,460
It's good to meet you, Sam.

22
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:58,885
It's your bed, right?

23
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,120
What's that?

24
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:02,632
Your bed, it's too soft.

25
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,459
When I was over there,
I'd sleep on the ground,

26
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,569
use rock for pillows, like a caveman.

27
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,897
Now I'm home, lying in my bed,
and it's like...

28
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:11,271
Lying on a marshmallow.

29
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,051
Feel like I'm gonna sink
right to the floor.

30
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:15,641
How long?

31
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,010
Two tours.

32
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,551
You must miss the good old days, huh?

33
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,920
Well, things aren't so bad.

34
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,488
Food's a lot better.
We used to boil everything.

35
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:26,853
No polio is good.

36
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:28,187
Internet, so helpful.

37
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,335
I've been reading that a lot,
trying to catch up.

38
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:35,923
Marvin Gaye, 1972,
Trouble Man soundtrack.

39
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:38,603
Everything you missed
jammed into one album.

40
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,705
I'll put it on the list.

41
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,042
All right, Sam, duty calls.
Thanks for the run.

42
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,612
If that's what you want to call running.

43
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:53,807
Oh, that's how it is?

44
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:55,434
- Oh, that's how it is.
- Okay.

45
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,954
Any time you want to stop by the VA,
make me look awesome

46
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:02,457
in front of the girl at the front desk,
just let me know.

47
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,220
<i>- I'll keep it in mind.
- Yeah.</i>

48
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,791
Hey, fellas.

49
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,870
Either one of you
know where the Smithsonian is?

50
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,164
I'm here to pick up a fossil.

51
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:14,628
That's hilarious.

52
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,645
- How you doing?
- Hey.

53
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,377
Can't run everywhere.

54
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,471
No, you can't.

55
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,417
Target is a mobile
satellite launch platform,

56
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:35,652
<i>the Lemurian Star.</i>

57
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,462
They were sending up their last payload
when pirates took them,

58
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,027
93 minutes ago.

59
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,995
- Any demands?
- Billion and a half.

60
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,235
- Why so steep?
- Because it's S.H.l. E.L.D.'s.

61
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,999
So it's not off-course. It's trespassing.

62
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,663
I'm sure they have a good reason.

63
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,537
You know, I'm getting a little
tired of being Fury's janitor.

64
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,575
Relax. It's not that complicated.

65
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:54,871
How many pirates?

66
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:57,506
25. Top mercs led by this guy.

67
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,741
Georges Batroc.
Ex-DGSE, Action Division.

68
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:03,853
He's at the top of lnterpol's Red Notice.

69
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,685
Before the French demobilised him,
he had 36 kill missions.

70
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,634
This guy's got a rep
for maximum casualties.

71
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:10,956
Hostages?

72
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,930
Oh, mostly techs. One officer.
Jasper Sitwell.

73
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,862
They're in the galley.

74
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,542
What's Sitwell doing on a launch ship?

75
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,534
All right, I'm gonna
sweep the deck and find Batroc.

76
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,205
Nat, you kill the engines
and wait for instructions.

77
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:24,198
Rumlow, you sweep aft,
find the hostages,

78
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,139
get them to the life-pods, get them out.
Let's move.

79
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,833
S.T.R.I.K.E., you heard the Cap.
Gear up.

80
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,585
Secure channel seven.

81
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:43,787
Seven secure.

82
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:45,420
Did you do anything fun
Saturday night?

83
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:49,065
Well, all the guys
from my barbershop quartet are dead,

84
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,758
so, no, not really.

85
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:53,065
<i>Coming up on the drop zone, Cap.</i>

86
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,264
You know, if you ask Kristen out,
from Statistics, she'd probably say yes.

87
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:58,164
That's why I don't ask.

88
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,636
<i>Too shy, or too scared?</i>

89
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,778
Too busy!

90
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,808
Was he wearing a parachute?

91
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:08,077
No.

92
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:09,745
No, he wasn't.

93
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:11,977
Ahh!

94
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,649
Ahh!

95
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,185
Hey!

96
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,058
Don't move.

97
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,230
Thanks.

98
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,465
Yeah. You seemed pretty
helpless without me.

99
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,810
What about the nurse that
lives across the hall from you?

100
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:19,940
She seems kind of nice.

101
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,760
Secure the engine room,
then find me a date.

102
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,445
I'm multi-tasking.

103
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:25,881
I told Batroc...

104
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:27,486
<i>If we want to make S.H.I.E.L.D. pay us...</i>

105
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,784
start sending them bodies now!

106
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,722
I have a bullet for someone...

107
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,056
You want a bullet in your head?

108
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,283
Move that foot - you want
a bullet in the head...?

109
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:39,901
Huh?

110
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,744
I don't like waiting.

111
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,009
<i>Call Durand.</i>

112
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,312
I want this ship ready to move
when the ransom comes.

113
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,084
Start the engines.

114
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,487
<i>Okay-</i>

115
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:07,821
Hey, sailor.

116
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,641
Shut up.

117
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,286
You want to be a hero? Is that it?

118
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,992
All right, I've waited long enough...

119
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,564
Hey!

120
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:46,659
Find Botroc...

121
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:47,727
If I don't hear anything in two minutes...

122
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,066
I start killing them!

123
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,296
I'll find him.

124
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,339
Two minutes.

125
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,015
Radio silence
from S.H.I.E.L.D., Batroc...

126
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:39,413
Targets acquired.

127
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,183
S.T.R.I.K.E. in position.

128
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,362
Natasha, whats your status?

129
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,020
<i>Status, Natasha.</i>

130
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,188
Hang on!

131
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:05,375
Engine room secure.

132
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,081
Time is up.

133
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,087
Who dies first...?

134
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:20,553
You!

135
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,621
Get that one.

136
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,225
On my mark.

137
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,002
Three...

138
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,502
<i>Two... One.</i>

139
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,907
I told you,
S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't negotiate.

140
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,020
The line just went dead.

141
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,755
I've lost contact with them...

142
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,087
Ahh!

143
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,431
Hostages en route to extraction.

144
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,707
<i>Romanoff missed
the rendezvous point, Cap.</i>

145
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,278
<i>Hostiles are still in play.</i>

146
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,777
Natasha, Batroc's on the move.

147
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,006
Circle back to Rumlow
and protect the hostages.

148
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:14,043
Natasha.

149
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,337
I thought you were
more than just a shield...

150
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,994
Let's see.

151
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,289
Well, this is awkward.

152
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:39,931
What are you doing?

153
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,299
Backing up the hard drive.

154
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:42,805
It's a good habit to get into.

155
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:44,366
Rumlow needed your help.

156
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:45,784
What the hell are you doing here?

157
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:50,689
You're saving S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.

158
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:51,977
Whatever I can get my hands on.

159
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,549
Our mission is to rescue hostages.

160
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,483
No, that's your mission,

161
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,550
and you've done it beautifully.

162
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,254
You just jeopardised
this whole operation.

163
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,807
I think that's overstating things.

164
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,938
<i>Okay.</i>

165
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,841
That one's on me.

166
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,247
You're damn right.

167
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,171
You just can't stop yourself
from lying, can you?

168
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,305
I didn't lie.

169
00:13:58,371 --> 00:13:59,714
Agent Romanoff
had a different mission than yours.

170
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,680
Which you didn't feel obliged to share.

171
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,444
I'm not obliged to do anything.

172
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,089
Those hostages could have died, Nick.

173
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:08,818
I sent the greatest soldier in history
to make sure that didn't happen.

174
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,215
Soldiers trust each other.
That's what makes it an army.

175
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,955
Not a bunch of guys
running around shooting guns.

176
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:16,328
Last time I trusted someone,
I lost an eye.

177
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:20,736
Look, I didn't want you doing
anything you weren't comfortable with.

178
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,999
Agent Romanoff is comfortable
with everything.

179
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,368
I can't lead a mission

180
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:26,305
when the people I'm leading
have missions of their own.

181
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:29,139
It's called companmentalisation.

182
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,009
Nobody spills the secrets,
because nobody knows them all.

183
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:33,972
Except you.

184
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,179
You're wrong about me.

185
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,252
I do share.

186
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,019
I'm nice like that.

187
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:46,988
Insight bay.

188
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,157
Captain Rogers does not have

189
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,554
<i>clearance for Project Insight.</i>

190
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,202
Director override. Fury, Nicholas J.

191
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,895
Confirmed.

192
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,339
You know, they used to play music.

193
00:14:58,998 --> 00:14:59,999
Yeah.

194
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,739
My grandfather operated one
of these things for 40 years.

195
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,246
Granddad worked in a nice building.

196
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:07,679
Got good tips.

197
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:12,348
He'd walk home every night,
a roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag.

198
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:13,853
He'd say, "Hi."

199
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,923
People would say, "Hi" back.

200
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,128
Time went on,
the neighbourhood got rougher.

201
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,219
He'd say, "Hi."

202
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:22,764
They'd say, "Keep on steppin'."

203
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,195
Granddad got to gripping that
lunch bag a little tighter.

204
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,026
Did he ever get mugged?

205
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,972
Every week some punk would say,
"What's in the bag?“

206
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:33,871
What would he do?

207
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,204
He'd show them.

208
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:39,247
Bunch of crumpled ones,
and a loaded .22 Magnum.

209
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,082
Yeah, Granddad loved people.

210
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,321
But he didn't trust them very much.

211
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,827
Yeah, I know.

212
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,399
They're a little bit bigger than a .22.

213
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,138
This is Project Insight.

214
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,501
Three next-generation helicarriers

215
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:40,371
synced to a network
of targeting satellites.

216
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,341
<i>Launched from the Lemurian Star.</i>

217
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:45,516
Once we get them in the air,
they never need to come down.

218
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:50,618
Continuous sub-orbital flight,
courtesy of our new repulsor engines.

219
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,118
Stark?

220
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,384
He had a few suggestions

221
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,823
once he got an up-close look
at our old turbines.

222
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,128
These new long-range precision guns

223
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,731
can eliminate 1,000 hostiles a minute.

224
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:06,130
The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA
before he steps outside his spider hole.

225
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:09,402
We're gonna neutralise a lot of threats
before they even happen.

226
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,669
Thought the punishment
usually came after the crime.

227
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,142
We can't afford to wait that long.

228
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:14,801
Who's "We"?

229
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:17,242
After New York, I convinced
the World Security Council

230
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,711
we needed a quantum surge
in threat analysis.

231
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,814
For once, we're way ahead of the curve.

232
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,490
By holding a gun to everyone on Earth
and calling it protection.

233
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,151
You know, I read those SSR files.

234
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,021
"Greatest Generation"?

235
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,390
You guys did some nasty stuff.

236
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:36,157
Yeah, we compromised.

237
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,576
Sometimes in ways that
made us not sleep so well.

238
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,232
But we did it
so that people could be free.

239
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,668
This isn't freedom. This is fear.

240
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:47,208
<i>S.H.I.E.L.D. takes the world as it is,
not as we'd like it to be.</i>

241
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,371
And it's getting damn near past time
for you to get with that programme, Cap.

242
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,214
Don't hold your breath.

243
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:14,872
<i>Welcome to the Smithsonian.</i>

244
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:18,531
<i>Visitor information booths are
available on the second level.</i>

245
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,712
<i>A symbol to the nation.</i>

246
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,651
<i>A hero to the world.</i>

247
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:39,894
<i>The story of Captain America
is one of honour, bravery and sacrifice.</i>

248
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:47,333
<i>Denied enlistment due to poor hearth,</i>

249
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,767
<i>Steven Rogers was chosen
for a programme</i>

250
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,102
<i>unique in the annals
of American warfare.</i>

251
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:59,072
<i>One that would transform him
into the world's first Super-Soldier.</i>

252
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:06,746
<i>In this rare footage,</i>

253
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,256
<i>everyone's favourite war hero,
Captain America...</i>

254
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:10,917
Battle tested,

255
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,084
<i>Captain America</i>

256
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:15,591
<i>and his Howling Commandos
quickly earned their stripes.</i>

257
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,797
<i>taking down HYDRA,
the Nazi rogue science division.</i>

258
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,132
<i>Best friends since childhood,</i>

259
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:30,444
<i>Bucky Barnes and Steven Rogers
were inseparable</i>

260
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:32,480
<i>on both schoolyard and battlefield.</i>

261
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:37,946
<i>Barnes is the only Howling
Commando to give his life</i>

262
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,647
<i>in service of his country.</i>

263
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:47,438
<i>That was a difficult winter.</i>

264
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,990
<i>A blizzard had trapped half
our battalion behind the German line.</i>

265
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,829
<i>Steve, Captain Rogers,</i>

266
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,667
<i>he fought his way
through a HYDRA blockade</i>

267
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,400
<i>that had pinned our allies
down for months.</i>

268
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,813
<i>He saved over 1,000 men.</i>

269
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,374
<i>Including the man who would...</i>

270
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,654
<i>Who would become my husband,
as it turned out.</i>

271
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,320
<i>Even after he died,
Steve was still changing my life.</i>

272
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,836
You should be
proud of yourself, Peggy.

273
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,200
<i>Mmm.</i>

274
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,332
I have lived a life.

275
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,439
My only regret is that
you didn't get to live yours.

276
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,705
What is it?

277
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:44,917
For as long as I can remember,
I just wanted to do what was right.

278
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,688
I guess I'm not quite sure
what that is any more.

279
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,930
And I thought I could
throw myself back in and follow orders.

280
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,466
Serve.

281
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,731
It's just not the same.

282
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:04,735
You're always so dramatic.

283
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,574
Look, you saved the world.

284
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,885
We rather mucked it up.

285
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:19,552
You didn't.

286
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,788
Knowing that you helped found
S.H.I.E.L.D. is half the reason I stay.

287
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,651
Hey!

288
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:32,764
The world has changed,
and none of us can go back.

289
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,132
All we can do is our best.

290
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:40,572
And sometimes the best that
we can do is to start over.

291
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,074
Peggy.

292
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:55,915
Steve.

293
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:57,784
Yeah?

294
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:00,759
You're alive.

295
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:04,496
You came back.

296
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:05,758
Yeah, Peggy-

297
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:11,536
It's been so long.

298
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,544
So long.

299
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:19,139
Well, I couldn't leave my best girl.

300
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,443
Not when she owes me a dance.

301
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:28,823
Secure office.

302
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:39,635
Open Lemurian Star's
satellite launch file.

303
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,366
<i>Access denied.</i>

304
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:44,063

<i>Decryption failed.</i>

306
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:51,509
Director override. Fury' Nicholas J.

307
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:56,543
<i>Override denied. All files sealed.</i>

308
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,221
On whose authority?

309
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,651
<i>Fury, Nicholas J.</i>

310
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,322
World Security Council.

311
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:08,692
<i>Confirmed.</i>

312
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,643
<i>If Nick Fury thinks
he can get his costumed thugs</i>

313
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:17,035
<i>and S.T.R.l.K.E. commandos to
mop up his mess, he's sadly mistaken.</i>

314
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,401
This failure is unacceptable.

315
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,201
Considering this attack took place

316
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,174
one mile from my country's
sovereign waters,

317
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,746
it's a bit more than that.
I move for immediate hearing.

318
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:26,848
We don't need hearings,
we need action.

319
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:29,111
It's this Council's duty
to oversee S.H.I.E.L.D.

320
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,285
A breach like this
raises serious questions.

321
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,183
Like how the hell did a French pirate

322
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:37,259
manage to hijack a covert S.H.I.E.L.D.
vessel in broad daylight?

323
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,520
For the record, Councilman,
he's Algerian.

324
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:42,187
I can draw a map if it'd help.

325
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:45,198
I appreciate your wit, Secretary Pierce.

326
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:48,938
But this Council takes things
like international piracy fairly seriously.

327
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:52,368
Really? I don't.

328
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,370
I don't care about one boat,
I care about the fleet.

329
00:23:57,469 --> 00:24:00,279
If this Council is going to fall to rancour

330
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,046
every time someone pushes us
on the playing field,

331
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,313
maybe we need someone to oversee us.

332
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:09,048
Mr Secretary,
nobody is suggesting...

333
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,153
Excuse me.

334
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:15,823
More trouble, Mr Secretary?

335
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:17,625
Depends on your definition.

336
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:29,470
I work 40 floors away
and it takes a hijacking for you to visit?

337
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,773
A nuclear war would do it, too.

338
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,178
You busy in there?

339
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,908
Nothing some earmarks can't fix.

340
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,187
I'm here to ask a favour.

341
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,858
I want you to call for a vote.

342
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:46,154
Project Insight has to be delayed.

343
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,758
Nick, that's not a favour,

344
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,634
that's a sub-committee hearing.
A long one.

345
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,376
It could be nothing.
It probably is nothing.

346
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,131
I just need time
to make sure it's nothing.

347
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,362
But if it's something?

348
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,371
Then we'll both be damn glad
those helicarriers aren't in the air.

349
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Fine.

350
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:06,706
But you got to get Iron Man
to stop by my niece's birthday party.

351
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:08,514
Thank you, sir.

352
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,620
And not just a flyby. He's got to mingle.

353
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,451
<i>The thing is,</i>

354
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:18,028
I think it's getting worse.

355
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,560
A cop pulled me over last week.

356
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:23,027
He thought I was drunk.

357
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,693
I swerved to miss a plastic bag.

358
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:30,903
I thought it was an IED.

359
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,075
Some stuff you leave there.

360
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,472
Other stuff you bring back.

361
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:40,549
It's our job to figure out how to carry it.

362
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:44,915
Is it gonna be in a big suitcase,
or in a little man-purse?

363
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:47,148
It's up to you.

364
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:49,787
- I'll see you next week.
Definitely.

365
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,027
Look who it is, the running man.

366
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,333
Caught the last few minutes.
It's pretty intense.

367
00:25:57,523 --> 00:26:00,504
Yeah, brother,
we all got the same problems.

368
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:02,399
Guilt,

369
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,067
regret.

370
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,199
You lose someone?

371
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:09,243
My wingman, Riley.

372
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,339
Flying a night mission.

373
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,847
Standard PJ rescue op.

374
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,076
Nothing we hadn't done
1,000 times before.

375
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:19,882
Until an RPG knocked Riley's
dumb ass out of the sky.

376
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:23,357
Nothing I could do.

377
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,918
It's like I was up there just to watch.

378
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:29,032
- I'm sorry.
- After that,

379
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:32,795
I had a really hard time finding a reason
for being over there, you know?

380
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,036
But you're happy now,
back in the world?

381
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:41,470
The number of people giving me
orders is down to about zero.

382
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,701
So, hell yeah.

383
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,202
Are you thinking about getting out?

384
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:46,872
No.

385
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,045
I don't know.

386
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:54,114
To be honest, I don't know
what I would do with myself if I did.

387
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:55,846
Ultimate fighting?

388
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:58,894
Just a great idea off the top of my head.

389
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:01,463
Seriously, you could do
whatever you want to do.

390
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,489
What makes you happy?

391
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:07,097

Okay. Bye.

440
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,663
My aunt, she's kind of an insomniac.

441
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,396
Yeah.

442
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,066
Hey, if you want...

443
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:56,472
If you want,
you're welcome to use my machine.

444
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,468
Might be cheaper
than the one in the basement.

Oh, yeah? What's it cost?

446
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,213
A cup of coffee?

447
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,655
Thank you, but

448
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,886
I already have a load in downstairs,

449
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,925

my scrubs in your machine.

450

00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,334
Well, I'll keep my distance.

452
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:19,661
Hopefully, not too far.

453
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:24,361
Oh, and I think you left your stereo on.

00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,730
Oh.

460
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:26,496

00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:51,026
I'm sorry to have to do this,
but I had no place else to crash.

465
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:03,531

00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:58,750

00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:04,120
Is he gonna make it?

483
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:05,660
I don't know.

484
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,730
Tell me about the shooter.

485
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,059
He's fast. Strong.

486
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:15,266
Had a metal arm.

487
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:21,838
Ballistics?

488
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,937
Three slugs, no rifling.

490
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:29,407

491
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:31,579
He's in V-tach.

492

495
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:39,160

496
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,761
Don't do this to me, Nick.

497
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:42,192
Stand back.

498
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:43,591

00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:45,492
one. Clear.

- No pulse.

501
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:49,764
Okay, 200, please.

502
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:50,965
Stand back!

503
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,438
Three, two, one. Clear!

504
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,601

Negative.

507
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:02,618
Don't do this to me, Nick.
Don't do this to me.

508
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:23,898

509
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:25,075

511
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,042
I need to take him.

512
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:24,091

513
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:38,971
Natasha!

514
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:41,912
Why was Fury in your apartment?

515
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,049
I don't know.

516
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:46,803

The honour's mine, Captain.

532
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:50,285
My father served in the 101st.
Come on in.

533
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:54,045
That photo was taken
five years after Nick and I met,

00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:03,795
and security got me out,
but the rebels took hostages.

537
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:07,465
Nick was Deputy Chief
of the S.H.I.E.L.D. station there,

538
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:08,899
and he comes to me with a plan.

539
00:42:09,127 --> 00:42:11,087
He wants to storm the building
through the sewers.

540
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:13,904
I said, "No, we'll negotiate."

541
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:18,504
Turned out, the E.L.N. didn't negotiate,
so they put out a kill order.

542
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:20,842
They stormed the basement,
and what do they find?

543
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,484
They find it empty.

544
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,551
Nick had ignored my direct order,

545
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:29,088
and carried out an unauthorised
military operation on foreign soil,

546
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:31,885
and saved the lives of
a dozen political officers,

547
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,320
including my daughter.

548
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,054
So you gave him a promotion.

549
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:36,823
I've never had any cause to regret it.

550
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:41,094
Captain, why was Nick
in your apartment last night?

551
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:46,266
I don't know.

552
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:48,875
Did you know it was bugged?

553
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:52,077
I did, because Nick told me.

554
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,050
Did he tell you
he was the one who bugged it?

555
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:03,019
I want you to see something.

556
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:05,348
<i>Who hired you, Batroc?</i>

557
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:06,516
Is that live?

558
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:10,230
Yeah, they picked him up last night
in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.

559
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:12,835
Are you saying he's a suspect?

560
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,528
Assassination isn't Batroc's line.

561
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:17,532
No, no.
It's more complicated than that.

562
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:20,266
Batroc was hired anonymously
to attack the Lemurian Star.

563
00:43:20,465 --> 00:43:23,969
And he was contacted by email
and paid by wire transfer,

564
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:28,582
and then the money was run through
17 fictitious accounts.

565
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:31,050
The last one going to
a holding company

566
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:33,416
that was registered to a Jacob Veech.

567
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:34,971
Am I supposed to know who that is?

568
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:37,115
Not likely. Veech died six years ago.

569
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:40,256
His last address was
1435 Elmhurst Drive.

570
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:44,296
When I first met Nick,
his mother lived at 1437.

571
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:49,268
Are you saying
Fury hired the pirates? Why?

572
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,433
The prevailing theory

573
00:43:52,497 --> 00:43:55,307
was that the hijacking was
a cover for the acquisition

574
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,912
and sale of classified intelligence.

575
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:02,513
The sale went sour
and that led to Nick's death.

576
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:08,452
If you really knew Nick Fury,
you'd know that's not true.

577
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,785
Why do you think we're talking?

578
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:17,956
See, I took a seat on the Council
not because I wanted to,

579
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:21,933
but because Nick asked me to,
because we were both realists.

580
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:27,705
We knew that, despite all the diplomacy
and the handshaking and the rhetoric,

581
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:30,945
to build a really better world

582
00:44:31,636 --> 00:44:34,810
sometimes means having
to tear the old one down.

583
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,486
And that makes enemies.

584
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:43,657
Those people that call you dirty
because you got the guts

585
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:46,624
to stick your hands in the mud
and try to build something better.

586
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:50,693
And the idea that those people
could be happy today

587
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:54,636
makes me really, really angry.

588
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,869
Captain, you were the last
one to see Nick alive.

589
00:45:00,965 --> 00:45:02,967
I don't think that's an accident.

590
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,138
And I don't think you do, either.

591
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,180
So, I'm gonna ask again.

592
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,383
Why was he there?

593
00:45:14,312 --> 00:45:16,588
He told me not to trust anyone.

594
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:21,056
I wonder if that included him.

595
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,164
I'm sorry.

596
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:28,599
Those were his last words.

597
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:31,434
Excuse me.

598
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,344
Captain,

599
00:45:36,534 --> 00:45:39,538
somebody murdered my friend
and I'm gonna find out why.

600
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:43,017
Anyone gets in my way,
they're gonna regret it.

601
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:45,752
Anyone.

602
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:50,124
Understood.

603
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:09,077
Operations Control.

604
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:10,644
Confirmed.

605
00:46:12,036 --> 00:46:14,277
Keep all S.T.R.I.K.E. personnel on site.

606
00:46:14,372 --> 00:46:15,715
- Understood.
- Yes, sir.

607
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:17,112
- Forensics.
- Confirmed.

608
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:18,480
Cap.

609
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:19,877
Rumlow.

610
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,229
Evidence Response found some fibres
on the roof they want us to see.

611
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:33,960
You want me to get the tac team ready?

612
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:35,758
No, let's wait and see what it is first.

613
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:36,963
Right.

614
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:50,514
What's the status so far?

615
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:53,622
- Administrations level.
- Confirmed.

616
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:55,355
Excuse me.

617
00:47:03,621 --> 00:47:05,862
I'm sorry about
what happened with Fury.

618
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:08,036
It's messed up, what happened to him.

619
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:09,602
Thank you.

620
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,547
Records.

621
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,884
Confirmed.

622
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:48,575
Before we get started,

623
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,302
does anyone want to get out?

624
00:48:25,436 --> 00:48:27,211
Mobilise S.T.R.l.K.E. units, 25th floor.

625
00:48:42,353 --> 00:48:43,855
Whoa, big guy-

626
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:47,629
I just want you to know, Cap,
this isn't personal!

627
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:00,541
It kind of feels personal.

628
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:11,549
Drop the shield
and put your hands in the air!

629
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:30,745
Give it up, Rogers! Get that door open!

630
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,580
You have nowhere to go!

631
00:49:52,423 --> 00:49:53,493
Are you kidding me?

632
00:49:53,591 --> 00:49:55,696
He's headed for the garage.
Lock down the bridge.

633
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:10,310
<i>Stand down, Captain Rogers.
Stand down.</i>

634
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:12,947
<i>Repeat, stand down.</i>

635
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,982
Eyes here.

636
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,259
Whatever your op is, bury it.

637
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:54,485
This is Level One.

638
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:56,726
Contact DOT.

639
00:50:56,921 --> 00:50:58,601
All traffic lights in the district go red.

640
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:01,094
Shut all runways at BWI,

641
00:51:01,492 --> 00:51:03,165
IAD and Reagan.

642
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,040
All security cameras in the city
go through this monitor right here.

643
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:08,267
Scan all open sources,

644
00:51:08,866 --> 00:51:10,209
phones, computers,

645
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:11,842
PDAs. Whatever.

646
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:13,990
If someone tweets about this guy,

647
00:51:14,038 --> 00:51:15,073
I want to know about it.

648
00:51:15,773 --> 00:51:17,343
With all due respect,
if S.H.I.E.L.D. is conducting

649
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:20,283
a manhunt for Captain America
we deserve to know why.

650
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:22,221
Because he lied to us.

651
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:27,351
Captain Rogers has information
regarding the death of Director Fury.

652
00:51:27,885 --> 00:51:29,455
He refused to share it.

653
00:51:30,521 --> 00:51:32,626
As difficult as this is to accept,

654
00:51:33,724 --> 00:51:37,035
Captain America is a fugitive
from S.H.I.E.L.D.

655
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:05,623
- Where is it?
- Safe.

656
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,427
- Do better.
- Where did you get it?

657
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:08,899
Why would I tell you?

658
00:52:09,093 --> 00:52:11,130
Fury gave it to you. Why?

659
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:12,739
- What's on it?
- I don't know.

660
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:13,931
Stop lying-

661
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,771
I only act like
I know everything, Rogers.

662
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:19,027
I bet you knew Fury hired
the pirates, didn't you?

663
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:22,990
Well, it makes sense. The ship was
dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.

664
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:24,413
I'm not gonna ask you again.

665
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:27,482
I know who killed Fury.

666
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:33,928
Most of the intelligence community
doesn't believe he exists.

667
00:52:34,118 --> 00:52:36,962
The ones that do
call him the Winter Soldier.

668
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,156
He's credited with over
two dozen assassinations

669
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:41,267
in the last 50 years.

670
00:52:41,692 --> 00:52:43,262
So he's a ghost story.

671
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:46,665
Five years ago, I was escorting
a nuclear engineer out of Iran.

672
00:52:46,864 --> 00:52:49,174
Somebody shot out
my tyres near Odessa.

673
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:51,642
We lost control,
went straight over a cliff.

674
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,143
I pulled us out.

675
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:55,214
But the Winter Soldier was there.

676
00:52:55,973 --> 00:52:58,283
I was covering my engineer
so he shot him

677
00:52:58,609 --> 00:52:59,610
straight through me.

678
00:53:00,444 --> 00:53:01,514
Soviet slug.

679
00:53:02,146 --> 00:53:04,717
No rifling. Bye-bye, bikinis.

680
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:08,127
Yeah, I bet you look terrible
in them now.

681
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:13,357
Going after him is a dead end.
I know, I've tried.

682
00:53:14,725 --> 00:53:16,796
<i>Like you said, he's a ghost story.</i>

683
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,542
Well, let's find out
what the ghost wants.

684
00:53:23,734 --> 00:53:25,873
<i>Nick Fury was murdered in cold blood.</i>

685
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,815
To any reasonable person,

686
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,511
that would make him a martyr,
not a traitor.

687
00:53:30,574 --> 00:53:31,985
You know what makes him a traitor?

688
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,486
Hiring a mercenary
to hijack his own ship.

689
00:53:34,645 --> 00:53:36,989
Nick Fury used your friendship

690
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:40,185
to coerce this Council
into delaying Project Insight.

691
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:42,665
A project he knew would expose
his own illegal operations.

692
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,899
At best, he lied to you. At worst...

693
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:48,400
Are you calling for my resignation?

694
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:50,032
I've got a pen and paper right here.

695
00:53:50,194 --> 00:53:52,731
That discussion can be tabled
for a later time.

696
00:53:53,931 --> 00:53:55,501
But you do want to have a discussion?

697
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:57,577
We've already had it, Mr Secretary.

698
00:53:58,669 --> 00:54:03,049
This Council moves to
immediately reactivate Project Insight.

699
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:07,686
If you want to say something snappy,
now would be a good time.

700
00:54:13,784 --> 00:54:17,095
First rule of going on the run
is don't run, walk.

701
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:20,199
If I run in these shoes,
they're gonna fall off.

702
00:54:23,227 --> 00:54:25,827
<i>The drive has a Level Six homing
program, so as soon as we boot up</i>

703
00:54:25,863 --> 00:54:27,740
S.H.I.E.L.D. will know
exactly where we are.

704
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:28,878
How much time will we have?

705
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:31,540
About nine minutes from

706
00:54:33,137 --> 00:54:34,207
now.

707
00:54:39,543 --> 00:54:41,147
Fury was right about that ship.

708
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:43,449
Somebody's trying to hide something.

709
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:45,627
This drive is protected
by some sort of Al.

710
00:54:45,816 --> 00:54:48,228
It keeps rewriting itself
to counter my commands.

711
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:50,056
Can you override it?

712
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:53,069
The person who developed this
is slightly smarter than me.

713
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:54,561
Slightly.

714
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:06,642
I'm gonna try running a tracer.

715
00:55:07,738 --> 00:55:09,498
This is a program
that S.H.I.E.L.D. developed

716
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:10,917
to track hostile malware,

717
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:13,850
so if we can't read the file,

718
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:15,677
maybe we can find out
where it came from.

719
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:17,606
Can I help you guys with anything?

720
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:21,622
Oh, no. My fiancé was just helping me
with some honeymoon destinations.

721
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,765
Right. We're getting married.

722
00:55:23,954 --> 00:55:26,194
Congratulations. Where are
you guys thinking about going?

723
00:55:27,758 --> 00:55:29,260
- New Jersey.
- Oh.

724
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:35,836
I have the exact same glasses.

725
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:38,440
Wow, you two are practically twins.

726
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,114
Yeah, I wish.

727
00:55:40,604 --> 00:55:41,605
Specimen.

728
00:55:42,306 --> 00:55:44,343
If you guys need anything,
I've been Aaron.

729
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:45,442
Thank you.

730
00:55:47,945 --> 00:55:50,289
- You said nine minutes. Come on.
- Relax.

731
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:52,619
Got it.

732
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:57,857
You know it?

733
00:55:57,955 --> 00:55:59,491
I used to. Let's go.

734
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:02,864
Standard tac team.

735
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,403
Two behind, two across,

736
00:56:04,628 --> 00:56:06,198
and two coming straight at us.

737
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:09,196
If they make us, I'll engage,
you hit the south escalator to the metro.

738
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:11,245
Shut up and put your arm around me.
Laugh at something I said.

739
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:12,674
- What?
- Do it.

740
00:56:20,978 --> 00:56:21,979
Negative at the source.

741
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:23,146
Give me a floor rundown.

742
00:56:23,647 --> 00:56:24,887
Negative on three.

743
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,375
Negative on two.

744
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,826
Snake the upper levels.
Work down to me.

745
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:37,860
- Kiss me.
What?

746
00:56:38,028 --> 00:56:40,030
Public displays of affection
make people very uncomfortable.

747
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,368
Yes, they do.

748
00:56:50,841 --> 00:56:52,411
You still uncomfortable?

749
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:54,863
It's not exactly the word I would use.

750
00:57:03,954 --> 00:57:06,093
Where did Captain America
learn how to steal a car?

751
00:57:07,057 --> 00:57:08,593
- Nazi Germany.
- Mmm.

752
00:57:09,026 --> 00:57:11,063
And we're borrowing.
Take your feet off the dash.

753
00:57:15,299 --> 00:57:18,872
All right, I have a question for you,
which you do not have to answer.

754
00:57:19,069 --> 00:57:20,446
I feel like, if you don't answer it though,

755
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:21,880
- you're kind of answering it, you know.
What?

756
00:57:22,072 --> 00:57:24,575
Was that your first kiss since 1945?

757
00:57:25,075 --> 00:57:26,554
- That bad, huh?
- I didn't say that.

758
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:28,280
Well, it kind of sounds like
that's what you're saying.

759
00:57:28,412 --> 00:57:29,482
No, I didn't.

760
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:31,490
I just wondered
how much practice you've had.

761
00:57:31,715 --> 00:57:33,319
- You don't need practice.
- Everybody needs practice.

762
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,757
It was not my first kiss since 1945.

763
00:57:36,153 --> 00:57:37,894
I'm 95, I'm not dead.

764
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,957
Nobody special, though?

765
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:43,295
Believe it or not, it's kind of hard

766
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:45,669
to find someone with
shared life experience.

767
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:47,762
Well, that's all right.
You just make something up.

768
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,744
- What, like you?
- I don't know.

769
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:51,071
The truth is a matter of circumstance.

770
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:53,578
It's not all things to all people,
all the time.

771
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:55,906
Neither am I.

772
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,914
That's a tough way to live.

773
00:57:59,109 --> 00:58:01,180
It's a good way not to die, though.

774
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,524
You know, it's kind of hard
to trust someone,

775
00:58:03,747 --> 00:58:05,587
when you don't know
who that someone really is.

776
00:58:06,283 --> 00:58:07,353
Yeah.

777
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:11,657
Who do you want me to be?

778
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:13,623
How about a friend?

779
00:58:17,094 --> 00:58:21,167
Well, there's a chance you might be
in the wrong business, Rogers.

780
00:58:36,947 --> 00:58:38,324
This is it.

781
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:41,495
The file came from these coordinates.

782
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:43,992
So did I.

783
00:58:52,162 --> 00:58:53,641
This camp is where I was trained.

784
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:57,804
Change much?

785
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:01,676
A little.

786
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:04,011
Pick up the pace, ladies!

787
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,811
Let's go! Let's go!

788
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:07,883
Double time!

789
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:11,181
Come on, Rogers, move it!

790
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,526
Come on, fall in!

791
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,658
Rogers!

792
00:59:19,089 --> 00:59:20,329
I said fall in!

793
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:23,831
This is a dead end.

794
00:59:23,994 --> 00:59:26,770
Zero heat signatures,
zero waves, not even radio.

795
00:59:28,198 --> 00:59:31,042
Whoever wrote the file must
have used a router to throw people off.

796
00:59:33,003 --> 00:59:34,004
What is it?

797
00:59:34,204 --> 00:59:36,124
Army regulations
forbid storing munitions

798
00:59:36,206 --> 00:59:38,117
within 500 yards of the barracks.

799
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,946
This building is in the wrong place.

800
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:58,202
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.

801
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:00,973
Maybe where it started.

802
01:00:19,049 --> 01:00:20,756
And there's Stark's father.

803
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:22,727
Howard.

804
01:00:24,054 --> 01:00:25,294
Who's the girl?

805
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:47,018
If you're already working
in a secret office,

806
01:00:57,587 --> 01:00:59,157
why do you need to hide the elevator?

807
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:54,651
This can't be the data point.
This technology is ancient.

808
01:02:24,608 --> 01:02:26,610
Y-E-S spells yes.

809
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,591
Shall we play a game?

810
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:35,594
- It's from a movie that was really...
- I know, I saw it.

811
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:43,804
<i>Rogers, Steven,</i>

812
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:46,534
<i>born 1918.</i>

813
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:52,407
<i>Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna,</i>

814
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,445
<i>born 1984.</i>

815
01:02:54,638 --> 01:02:55,981
It's some kind of recording.

816
01:02:56,206 --> 01:02:58,550
<i>I am not a recording, Fräulein.</i>

817
01:02:59,209 --> 01:03:00,916
<i>I may not be the man I was</i>

818
01:03:01,211 --> 01:03:04,385
<i>when the Captain took me
prisoner in 1945.</i>

819
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:06,485
<i>But I am.</i>

820
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:09,763
You know this thing?

821
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:16,160
Arnim Zola was a German
scientist who worked for the Red Skull.

822
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:17,594
He's been dead for years.

823
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,104
<i>Firs! correction, I am Swiss.</i>

824
01:03:20,497 --> 01:03:22,909
<i>Second, look around you.</i>

825
01:03:23,066 --> 01:03:25,672
<i>I have never been more alive.</i>

826
01:03:26,236 --> 01:03:30,514
<i>In 1972,
I received a terminal diagnosis.</i>

827
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:33,482
<i>Science could not save my body.</i>

828
01:03:33,777 --> 01:03:37,919
<i>My mind, however,
that was worth saving,</i>

829
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:41,857
<i>on 200,000 feet of databanks.</i>

830
01:03:42,085 --> 01:03:45,658
<i>You are standing in my brain.</i>

831
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:48,096
- How did you get here?
- Invited.

832
01:03:48,692 --> 01:03:50,933
It was Operation Paperclip
after World War ll.

833
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:54,768
S.H.I.E.L.D. recruited
German scientists with strategic value.

834
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:57,104
<i>They thought I could help their cause.</i>

835
01:03:57,267 --> 01:03:59,144
<i>I also helped my own.</i>

836
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:00,838
HYDRA died with the Red Skull.

837
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:04,951
<i>Cut off one head,
two more shall take its place.</i>

838
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:06,787
Prove it.

839
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:10,055
<i>Accessing archive.</i>

840
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:13,958
<i>HYDRA was founded on
the belief that humanity</i>

841
01:04:14,117 --> 01:04:17,291
<i>could not be trusted
with its own freedom.</i>

842
01:04:17,487 --> 01:04:20,161
<i>What we did not realise was
that if you try</i>

843
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:23,167
<i>to take that freedom, they resist.</i>

844
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:25,563
<i>The war taught us much.</i>

845
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:29,473
<i>Humanity needed to surrender
its freedom willingly.</i>

846
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:33,341
<i>After the war,
S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded,</i>

847
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,641
<i>and I was recruited.</i>

848
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:38,074
<i>The new HYDRA grew.</i>

849
01:04:38,308 --> 01:04:42,552
<i>A beautiful parasite inside S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>

850
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:44,652
<i>For 70 years,</i>

851
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:50,423
<i>HYDRA has been secretly
feeding crisis, reaping war,</i>

852
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:53,327
<i>and when history did not cooperate,</i>

853
01:04:54,157 --> 01:04:55,830
<i>history was changed.</i>

854
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:58,332
That's impossible.
S.H.I.E.L.D. would have stopped you.

855
01:04:58,428 --> 01:05:00,874
<i>Accidents will happen.</i>

856
01:05:02,866 --> 01:05:05,676
<i>HYDRA created a world so chaotic</i>

857
01:05:05,869 --> 01:05:09,715
<i>that humanity is finally ready
to sacrifice its freedom</i>

858
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:12,041
<i>to gain its security.</i>

859
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:16,085
<i>Once a purification process
is complete,</i>

860
01:05:16,613 --> 01:05:20,026
<i>HYDRA's new world order will arise.</i>

861
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,863
<i>We won, Captain.</i>

862
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:26,523
<i>Your death amounts to
the same as your life.</i>

863
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:28,058
<i>A zero sum.</i>

864
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:33,571
<i>As I was saying...</i>

865
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:35,432
What's on this drive?

866
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:38,941
<i>Project Insight requires insight.</i>

867
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:41,939
<i>So, I wrote an algorithm.</i>

868
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:43,613
What kind of algorithm?
What does it do?

869
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:46,209
<i>The answer to your question
is fascinating.</i>

870
01:05:46,643 --> 01:05:50,716
<i>Unfortunately, you shall
be too dead to hear it.</i>

871
01:05:56,553 --> 01:05:57,964
Steve, we got a bogey.

872
01:05:58,421 --> 01:05:59,957
Short range ballistic.

873
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,963
- 30 seconds tops.
- Who fired it?

874
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:03,059
S.H.I.E.L.D.

875
01:06:03,226 --> 01:06:06,969
<i>I am afraid
I have been stalling, Captain.</i>

876
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:08,568
<i>Admit it.</i>

877
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:10,972
<i>It's better this way.</i>

878
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:12,578
<i>We are, both of us,</i>

879
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:15,143
<i>out of time.</i>

880
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:40,091
Call in the asset.

881
01:07:56,339 --> 01:07:57,739
I'm going to go, Mr Pierce.

882
01:07:58,241 --> 01:08:00,050
You need anything before I leave?

883
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:04,120
No... Uh, it's fine, Renata,
you can go home.

884
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,454
Okay. Night-night.

885
01:08:06,683 --> 01:08:08,356
Good night.

886
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:14,867
Want some milk?

887
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:26,310
The timetable has moved.

888
01:08:28,471 --> 01:08:30,212
Our window is limited.

889
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:36,382
Two targets, Level Six.

890
01:08:37,814 --> 01:08:40,055
They already cost me Zola.

891
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:42,456
I want confirmed death in 10 hours.

892
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,559
Sorry, Mr Pierce, I...

893
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:48,330
I forgot my

894
01:08:48,558 --> 01:08:49,662
phone.

895
01:08:54,731 --> 01:08:57,837
Oh, Renata,
I wish you would have knocked.

896
01:09:22,425 --> 01:09:23,495
Hey, man.

897
01:09:23,593 --> 01:09:27,097
I'm sorry about this.
We need a place to lay low.

898
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:28,934
Everyone we know is trying to kill us.

899
01:09:31,868 --> 01:09:33,370
Not everyone.

900
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:52,026
- You okay?
- Yeah.

901
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:02,465
What's going on?

902
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:09,149
When I first joined S.H.I.E.L.D.
I thought I was going straight.

903
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:15,888
But I guess I just traded in
the KGB for HYDRA.

904
01:10:21,751 --> 01:10:23,856
I thought I knew whose lies I was telling,

905
01:10:27,657 --> 01:10:30,399
but I guess I can't tell
the difference any more.

906
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:33,467
There's a chance you might be
in the wrong business.

907
01:10:38,668 --> 01:10:39,738
I owe you.

908
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:42,340
It's okay.

909
01:10:42,872 --> 01:10:45,079
If it was the other way around,

910
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:47,942
and it was down to me to save your life,

911
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:49,512
now you be honest with me,

912
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:53,558
would you trust me to do it?

913
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:56,719
I would now.

914
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:01,531
And I'm always honest.

915
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:04,019
Well, you seem pretty chipper

916
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:06,273
for someone who just found out
they died for nothing.

917
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:10,438
Well, guess I just like to
know who I'm fighting.

918
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:12,301
I made breakfast.

919
01:11:12,969 --> 01:11:15,916
If you guys eat that sort of thing.

920
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:18,884
So, the question is,

921
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:21,361
who at S.H.I.E.L.D. could launch
a domestic missile strike?

922
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:24,113
Pierce.

923
01:11:24,413 --> 01:11:27,053
Who happens to be sitting on top
of the most secure building in the world.

924
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:28,388
But he's not working alone.

925
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:30,894
Zola's algorithm
was on the Lemurian Star.

926
01:11:32,054 --> 01:11:33,556
So was Jasper Sitwell.

927
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:39,546
So, the real question is,
how do the two most wanted people

928
01:11:39,729 --> 01:11:42,642
in Washington kidnap
a S.H.I.E.L.D. officer in broad daylight?

929
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:45,343
The answer is, you don't.

930
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,077
- What's this?
- Call it a résumé.

931
01:11:51,741 --> 01:11:53,277
Is this Bakhmala?

932
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:55,076
The Khalid Khandil mission,
that was you?

933
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:58,046
You didn't say he was a Pararescue.

934
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:01,921
- Is this Riley?
- Yeah.

935
01:12:02,118 --> 01:12:04,359
I heard they couldn't bring
in the choppers because of the RPGs.

936
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:05,799
What did you use? A stealth chute?

937
01:12:05,855 --> 01:12:06,925
No.

938
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:09,102
These.

939
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:15,436
I thought you said you were a pilot.

940
01:12:15,598 --> 01:12:16,941
I never said pilot.

941
01:12:20,937 --> 01:12:22,678
I can't ask you to do this, Sam.

942
01:12:23,306 --> 01:12:24,717
You got out for a good reason.

943
01:12:24,941 --> 01:12:26,443
Dude, Captain America needs my help.

944
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:28,242
There's no better reason to get back in.

945
01:12:31,948 --> 01:12:33,621
Where can we get our hands on
one of these things?

946
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:35,016
The last one is at Fort Meade.

947
01:12:35,985 --> 01:12:38,488
Behind three guarded gates
and a 12-inch steel wall.

948
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:42,662
Shouldn't be a problem.

949
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,964
Listen, I got to fly home tonight

950
01:12:46,162 --> 01:12:48,972
because I got
some constituency problem

951
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:51,042
and I got to press the flesh.

952
01:12:51,234 --> 01:12:53,544
Any constituent in particular,
Mr Senator'?

953
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:55,515
Oh, no, not really.

954
01:12:56,472 --> 01:12:58,349
Twenty-three, kind of hot.

955
01:12:59,008 --> 01:13:00,146
Real hot, you know?

956
01:13:00,343 --> 01:13:02,482
Wants to be a reporter, I think.
I don't know.

957
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:03,718
Who listens at that point?

958
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,560
Doesn't sound like
much of a problem to me.

959
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:07,820
Really? Because she's killing my back.

960
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:10,526
But this isn't the place to talk about it.

961
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:11,755
This is a nice pin.

962
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:15,160
- Thank you.
- Come here.

963
01:13:15,992 --> 01:13:17,335
Hail HYDRA.

964
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:22,496
- See, it's right there...
- Yeah, I just saw that.

965
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,112
- Should I get it checked?
- I think you should.

966
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:34,680
I need a minute.

967
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:36,550
Bring the car around.

968
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:41,354
YES, sir?

969
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,090
<i>Agent Sitwell, how was lunch?</i>

970
01:13:43,286 --> 01:13:45,892
<i>I hear the crab cakes here
are delicious.</i>

971
01:13:46,022 --> 01:13:47,057
Who is this?

972
01:13:47,223 --> 01:13:49,897
<i>The good-looking guy in the
sunglasses, your 10 o'clock.</i>

973
01:13:52,028 --> 01:13:53,132
<i>Your other 10 o' clock.</i>

974
01:13:55,031 --> 01:13:56,032
<i>There you go.</i>

975
01:13:58,868 --> 01:14:00,370
What do you want?

976
01:14:00,569 --> 01:14:02,409
<i>You're gonna go around
the comer to your right.</i>

977
01:14:02,571 --> 01:14:05,074
There's a grey car two spaces down.

978
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,117
You and I are gonna take a ride.

979
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:09,051
And why would I do that?

980
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:11,782
Because that tie looks really expensive,

981
01:14:12,248 --> 01:14:14,228
<i>and I'd hate to mess it up.</i>

982
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,067
Tell me about Zola's algorithm.

983
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:27,129
Never heard of it.

984
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:28,264
<i>What were you doing
on the Lemurian Star?</i>

985
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:30,072
I was throwing up. I get seasick.

986
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:38,477
Is this little display meant to insinuate
that you're gonna throw me off the roof?

987
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:41,255
Because it's really not
your style, Rogers.

988
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:43,245
You're right.

989
01:14:44,113 --> 01:14:45,148
It's not.

990
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:46,682
It's hers.

991
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:53,190
Oh, wait. What about that girl
from Accounting, Laura...

992
01:14:53,756 --> 01:14:55,599
Lillian. Lip piercing, right?

993
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:56,830
Yeah, she's cute.

994
01:14:56,926 --> 01:14:58,428
Yeah. I'm not ready for that.

995
01:15:10,306 --> 01:15:12,343
Zola's algorithm is a program

996
01:15:14,043 --> 01:15:15,147
for choosing

997
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:16,880
- insight's targets.
- What targets?

998
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:18,349
You!

999
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:21,726
A TV anchor in Cairo,
the Under Secretary of Defence,

1000
01:15:21,951 --> 01:15:24,363
a high school valedictorian in Iowa City,

1001
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:26,660
Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange,
anyone who's a threat

1002
01:15:26,956 --> 01:15:28,526
to HYDRA.

1003
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:30,465
Now, or in the future.

1004
01:15:30,793 --> 01:15:32,534
In the future? How could it know?

1005
01:15:36,132 --> 01:15:37,167
How could it not?

1006
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:42,646
The 21st century is a digital book.

1007
01:15:43,973 --> 01:15:45,816
Zola taught HYDRA how to read it.

1008
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:49,849
Your bank records,

1009
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:51,712
medical histories, voting patterns,

1010
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:54,327
emails, phone calls,
your damn SAT scores!

1011
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:59,196
Zola's algorithm
evaluates people's past

1012
01:16:00,089 --> 01:16:01,329
to predict their future.

1013
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:02,692
And what then?

1014
01:16:06,095 --> 01:16:07,904
Oh, my God. Pierce is gonna kill me.

1015
01:16:07,997 --> 01:16:09,533
What then?

1016
01:16:12,101 --> 01:16:15,207
Then the Insight helicarriers
scratch people off the list.

1017
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,283
A few million at a time.

1018
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,020
HYDRA doesn't like leaks.

1019
01:16:28,184 --> 01:16:29,984
Then why don't you try
sticking a cork in it'?

1020
01:16:30,052 --> 01:16:31,360
Insight's launching in 16 hours.

1021
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:32,555
We're cutting it a little bit close here.

1022
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:34,701
I know.
We'll use him to bypass the DNA scans

1023
01:16:34,857 --> 01:16:36,337
and access the helicarriers directly.

1024
01:16:36,459 --> 01:16:37,529
What? Are you crazy?

1025
01:16:38,394 --> 01:16:40,154
That is a terrible, terrible idea.

1026
01:17:23,806 --> 01:17:25,012
<i>Shit!</i>

1027
01:17:36,418 --> 01:17:37,795
Hang on!

1028
01:19:18,187 --> 01:19:21,134
I have her. Find him.

1029
01:20:26,422 --> 01:20:27,423
Go! I got this!

1030
01:21:07,463 --> 01:21:09,136
<i>Taking fire above
and below expressway.</i>

1031
01:21:09,298 --> 01:21:11,744
<i>Civilians threatened.
Repeat, civilians threatened.</i>

1032
01:21:15,904 --> 01:21:18,646
<i>I make an LZ,
2300 block of Virginia Avenue.</i>

1033
01:21:18,807 --> 01:21:19,877
<i>Rendezvous, two minutes.</i>

1034
01:21:45,334 --> 01:21:46,335
Get out of the way!

1035
01:21:46,869 --> 01:21:48,507
Stay out of the way!

1036
01:21:49,938 --> 01:21:51,417
Ahh!

1037
01:23:35,544 --> 01:23:36,614
Bucky?

1038
01:23:37,179 --> 01:23:38,624
Who the hell is Bucky?

1039
01:24:07,309 --> 01:24:08,869
Drop the shield, Cap!
Get on your knees!

1040
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:10,422
Get on your knees!

1041
01:24:10,646 --> 01:24:13,217
Get down, get down! Get on your knees!

1042
01:24:13,315 --> 01:24:14,419
Down!

1043
01:24:14,983 --> 01:24:15,984
Don't move.

1044
01:24:22,991 --> 01:24:24,231
Put the gun down.

1045
01:24:24,426 --> 01:24:26,372
Not here. Not here!

1046
01:24:41,877 --> 01:24:42,912
It was him.

1047
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:49,685
He looked right at me
like he didn't even know me.

1048
01:24:50,218 --> 01:24:52,926
How is that even possible?
It was, like, 70 years ago.

1049
01:24:53,121 --> 01:24:54,361
Zola.

1050
01:24:54,523 --> 01:24:56,127
Bucky's whole unit was captured in '43.

1051
01:24:56,358 --> 01:24:58,201
Zola experimented on him.

1052
01:24:58,393 --> 01:25:00,703
Whatever he did
helped Bucky survive the fall.

1053
01:25:02,397 --> 01:25:03,705
They must have found him and...

1054
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:05,711
None of that's your fault, Steve.

1055
01:25:09,304 --> 01:25:11,045
Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky.

1056
01:25:14,376 --> 01:25:16,083
We need to get a doctor here.

1057
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:17,279
If we don't put pressure on that wound,

1058
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:19,079
she's gonna bleed out here in the truck.

1059
01:25:26,388 --> 01:25:29,494
Ah. That thing was squeezing my brain.

1060
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:33,664
Who is this guy?

1061
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:46,453
Three holes. Stan digging.

1062
01:26:13,602 --> 01:26:15,513
GSW. She's lost at least a pint.

1063
01:26:15,704 --> 01:26:16,944
Maybe two.

1064
01:26:17,105 --> 01:26:19,107
- Let me take her.
- She'll want to see him first.

1065
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:31,224
About damn time.

1066
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:34,826
Lacerated spinal column,

1067
01:26:35,457 --> 01:26:36,800
cracked sternum,

1068
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:38,462
shattered collarbone,

1069
01:26:38,627 --> 01:26:40,300
perforated liver,

1070
01:26:40,462 --> 01:26:42,203
and one hell of a headache.

1071
01:26:42,464 --> 01:26:43,807
Don't forget your collapsed lung.

1072
01:26:43,999 --> 01:26:45,307
Let's not forget that.

1073
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,138
Otherwise, I'm good.

1074
01:26:47,502 --> 01:26:49,641
They cut you open. Your heart stopped.

1075
01:26:49,838 --> 01:26:51,875
Tetrodotoxin B.

1076
01:26:52,074 --> 01:26:54,054
Slows the pulse to one beat a minute.

1077
01:26:54,242 --> 01:26:56,051
Banner developed it for stress.

1078
01:26:56,244 --> 01:26:58,850
Didn't work so great for him,
but we found a use for it.

1079
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:00,924
Why all the secrecy?
Why not just tell us?

1080
01:27:01,149 --> 01:27:03,430
Any attempt on the Director's
life had to look successful.

1081
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:06,092
Can't kill you if you're already dead.

1082
01:27:06,421 --> 01:27:07,525
Besides,

1083
01:27:08,824 --> 01:27:10,326
I wasn't sure who to trust.

1084
01:27:25,841 --> 01:27:27,184
Sergeant Barnes.

1085
01:27:29,344 --> 01:27:30,345
Bucky, no!

1086
01:27:34,049 --> 01:27:37,121
<i>The procedure has already started.</i>

1087
01:27:41,022 --> 01:27:44,697
<i>You are to be the new fist of HYDRA.</i>

1088
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:46,094
<i>Put him on ice.</i>

1089
01:27:57,472 --> 01:27:58,473
Sir.

1090
01:27:59,207 --> 01:28:00,709
He's unstable.

1091
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:02,620
Erratic.

1092
01:28:15,891 --> 01:28:16,961
Mission report.

1093
01:28:20,462 --> 01:28:21,805
Mission report now.

1094
01:28:34,609 --> 01:28:36,020
The man on the bridge.

1095
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:40,421
Who was he?

1096
01:28:41,817 --> 01:28:44,093
You met him earlier this week
on another assignment.

1097
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:48,498
I knew him.

1098
01:28:57,098 --> 01:28:59,772
Your work has been a gift to mankind.

1099
01:29:02,037 --> 01:29:03,448
You shaped the century.

1100
01:29:04,139 --> 01:29:06,619
And I need you to do it one more time.

1101
01:29:07,876 --> 01:29:11,551
Society's at a tipping point
between order and chaos.

1102
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:14,454
And tomorrow morning,
we're gonna give it a push.

1103
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:18,793
But, if you don't do your part,
I can't do mine.

1104
01:29:20,455 --> 01:29:23,299
And HYDRA can't give the world
the freedom it deserves.

1105
01:29:26,328 --> 01:29:27,898
But I knew him.

1106
01:29:34,469 --> 01:29:35,971
Prep him.

1107
01:29:36,171 --> 01:29:38,742
He's been out of cryo freeze too long.

1108
01:29:38,974 --> 01:29:40,976
Then wipe him and start over.

1109
01:30:22,684 --> 01:30:26,257
This man declined
the Nobel Peace Prize.

1110
01:30:27,022 --> 01:30:30,265
He said peace wasn't an achievement,

1111
01:30:30,725 --> 01:30:32,796
it was a responsibility.

1112
01:30:33,795 --> 01:30:37,072
See, it's stuff like this
that gives me trust issues.

1113
01:30:37,799 --> 01:30:39,073
We have to stop the launch.

1114
01:30:40,035 --> 01:30:42,777
I don't think the Council's
accepting my calls any more.

1115
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:46,377
What's that?

1116
01:30:46,741 --> 01:30:49,415
Once the helicarriers reach 3,000 feet,

1117
01:30:49,477 --> 01:30:52,822
they'll triangulate with Insight
satellites, becoming fully weaponised.

1118
01:30:53,548 --> 01:30:55,221
We need to breach those carriers

1119
01:30:55,417 --> 01:30:57,954
and replace their targeting
blades with our own.

1120
01:30:58,053 --> 01:30:59,253
One or two won't cut it.

1121
01:30:59,254 --> 01:31:01,757
We need lo link all three
carriers for this to work,

1122
01:31:01,957 --> 01:31:05,302
because if even one of those
ships remains operational,

1123
01:31:05,493 --> 01:31:07,302
a whole lot of people are gonna die.

1124
01:31:07,495 --> 01:31:10,669
We have to assume everyone aboard
those carriers is HYDRA.

1125
01:31:10,999 --> 01:31:13,104
We have to get past them,
insert these server blades.

1126
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:16,407
And maybe, just maybe
we can salvage what's left...

1127
01:31:16,604 --> 01:31:17,605
We're not salvaging anything.

1128
01:31:17,806 --> 01:31:19,080
We're not just
taking down the carriers, Nick.

1129
01:31:19,274 --> 01:31:20,309
We're taking down S.H.I.E.L.D.

1130
01:31:20,408 --> 01:31:21,682
S.H.I.E.L.D. had nothing to do with this.

1131
01:31:21,910 --> 01:31:24,083
You gave me this mission.
This is how it ends.

1132
01:31:24,179 --> 01:31:26,299
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been compromised.
You said so yourself.

1133
01:31:26,514 --> 01:31:28,255
HYDRA grew right under your nose
and nobody noticed.

1134
01:31:28,416 --> 01:31:31,590
Why do you think we're meeting
in this cave? I noticed.

1135
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,627
How many paid the price
before you did?

1136
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:38,433
Look, I didn't know about Barnes.

1137
01:31:38,626 --> 01:31:40,506
Even if you had,
would you have told me?

1138
01:31:40,695 --> 01:31:43,437
Or would you have
compartmentalised that, too?

1139
01:31:43,631 --> 01:31:46,441
S.H.I.E.L.D., HYDRA,

1140
01:31:46,634 --> 01:31:47,942
it all goes.

1141
01:31:48,436 --> 01:31:49,642
He's right.

1142
01:31:55,443 --> 01:31:56,478
Don't look at me.

1143
01:31:56,678 --> 01:31:58,555
I do what he does, just slower.

1144
01:32:02,283 --> 01:32:03,956
Well...

1145
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:12,637
It looks like you're giving
the orders now, Captain.

1146
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:25,718
<i>We looked for you, after.</i>

1147
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:29,010
<i>My folks wanted to give you
a ride to the cemetery.</i>

1148
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:32,817
I know, I'm sorry.
I just kind of wanted to be alone.

1149
01:32:33,915 --> 01:32:35,326
How was it?

1150
01:32:35,817 --> 01:32:37,262
It was okay.

1151
01:32:37,719 --> 01:32:39,665
She's next to Dad.

1152
01:32:41,156 --> 01:32:42,396
I was gonna ask...

1153
01:32:42,824 --> 01:32:44,584
I know what you're gonna say, Buck.
I just...

1154
01:32:45,427 --> 01:32:46,929
We can put the
couch cushions on the floor

1155
01:32:47,162 --> 01:32:48,664
like when we were kids.

1156
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:51,833
It'll be fun.
All you got to do is shine my shoes,

1157
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:53,906
maybe take out the trash.

1158
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:00,385
Come on.

1159
01:33:03,411 --> 01:33:06,858
Thank you, Buck,
but I can get by on my own.

1160
01:33:07,615 --> 01:33:11,427
The thing is, you don't have to.

1161
01:33:14,756 --> 01:33:16,396
I'm with you to the end of the line, pal.

1162
01:33:19,694 --> 01:33:21,037
He's gonna be there, you know.

1163
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:22,131
I know.

1164
01:33:23,031 --> 01:33:26,376
Look, whoever he used to be
and the guy he is now,

1165
01:33:27,035 --> 01:33:29,208
I don't think he's the kind you save.

1166
01:33:29,404 --> 01:33:30,883
He's the kind you stop.

1167
01:33:33,541 --> 01:33:35,111
I don't know if I can do that.

1168
01:33:35,443 --> 01:33:37,423
Well, he might not give you a choice.

1169
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:39,091
He doesn't know you.

1170
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:40,816
He will.

1171
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:44,892
Gear up. It's time.

1172
01:33:47,555 --> 01:33:48,625
You gonna wear that?

1173
01:33:48,890 --> 01:33:52,269
No. If you're gonna fight a war,
you got to wear a uniform.

1174
01:34:00,168 --> 01:34:01,613
Oh, man.

1175
01:34:02,403 --> 01:34:04,474
I am so fired.

1176
01:34:29,364 --> 01:34:31,605
<i>We are in final launch sequence.</i>

1177
01:34:33,268 --> 01:34:35,179
We are go on guidance.

1178
01:34:37,105 --> 01:34:39,210
<i>All personnel to launch stations.</i>

1179
01:34:39,974 --> 01:34:41,254
And how was your flight?

1180
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:42,377
Lovely.

1181
01:34:42,477 --> 01:34:44,980
The ride from the airport, less so.

1182
01:34:45,113 --> 01:34:47,616
Sadly, S.H.I.E.L.D. can't
control everything.

1183
01:34:47,782 --> 01:34:49,693
Including Captain America.

1184
01:34:53,121 --> 01:34:55,692
This facility is biometrically controlled.

1185
01:34:55,890 --> 01:34:58,803
And these will give you
unrestricted access.

1186
01:35:02,730 --> 01:35:03,902
I've been parking there for two months.

1187
01:35:04,132 --> 01:35:05,702
- But it's his spot.
- So where's he been?

1188
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:07,174
I think Afghanistan.

1189
01:35:07,235 --> 01:35:09,237
Negative DT Six. The pattern is full.

1190
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:10,790
Well, he could've said something.

1191
01:35:10,838 --> 01:35:12,340
Ahh!

1192
01:35:12,407 --> 01:35:13,715
Must be the dish.

1193
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:17,148
I'll check it out.

1194
01:35:17,979 --> 01:35:20,983
<i>Triskelion command
request we clear the area for launch.</i>

1195
01:35:24,652 --> 01:35:25,652
Excuse us.

1196
01:35:25,687 --> 01:35:28,167
<i>I know the road
hasn't exactly been smooth,</i>

1197
01:35:28,656 --> 01:35:32,001
and some of you would have gladly
kicked me out of the car along the way.

1198
01:35:34,229 --> 01:35:35,229
Finally, we're here.

1199
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:37,876
And the world should be grateful.

1200
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:40,713
<i>Attention all S.H.I.E.L.D. agents,</i>

1201
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:42,510
<i>this is Steve Rogers.</i>

1202
01:35:44,272 --> 01:35:46,513
<i>You've heard a lot about me
over the last few days.</i>

1203
01:35:47,542 --> 01:35:49,783
<i>Some of you were even ordered
to hunt me down.</i>

1204
01:35:50,511 --> 01:35:53,390
But I think it's time you know the truth.

1205
01:35:56,517 --> 01:35:58,690
S.H.I.E.L.D. is not
what we thought it was.

1206
01:35:58,886 --> 01:36:00,593
It's been taken over by HYDRA.

1207
01:36:01,723 --> 01:36:03,396
<i>Alexander Pierce is their leader.</i>

1208
01:36:07,528 --> 01:36:09,872
<i>The S.T.R.I.K.E. and insight crew
are HYDRA as well.</i>

1209
01:36:10,064 --> 01:36:11,144
<i>I don't know how many more,</i>

1210
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:13,800
but I know they're in the building.

1211
01:36:15,203 --> 01:36:17,080
<i>They could be standing
right next to you.</i>

1212
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:20,313
<i>They almost have what they want.</i>

1213
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:23,214
<i>Absolute control.</i>

1214
01:36:23,711 --> 01:36:25,054
They shot Nick Fury.

1215
01:36:26,147 --> 01:36:27,285
<i>And it won't end there.</i>

1216
01:36:27,815 --> 01:36:30,056
If you launch those helicarriers today,

1217
01:36:30,218 --> 01:36:32,538
<i>HYDRA will be able to kill
anyone that stands in their way.</i>

1218
01:36:35,490 --> 01:36:36,901
<i>Unless we stop them.</i>

1219
01:36:40,895 --> 01:36:41,999
<i>I know I'm asking a lot.</i>

1220
01:36:43,931 --> 01:36:47,105
<i>But the price of freedom is high.
It always has been.</i>

1221
01:36:47,835 --> 01:36:49,746
And it's a price I'm willing to pay.

1222
01:36:52,106 --> 01:36:54,916
And if I'm the only one, then so be it.

1223
01:36:56,577 --> 01:36:58,318
But I'm willing to bet I'm not.

1224
01:37:03,084 --> 01:37:06,361
Did you write that down first,
or was it off the top of your head?

1225
01:37:06,854 --> 01:37:08,492
You smug son of a bitch.

1226
01:37:12,593 --> 01:37:13,628
Arrest him.

1227
01:37:16,497 --> 01:37:18,135
I guess I've got the floor.

1228
01:37:25,006 --> 01:37:27,953
Preempt the launch sequence.
Send those ships up now.

1229
01:37:32,313 --> 01:37:33,815
Is there a problem?

1230
01:37:33,881 --> 01:37:34,882
Um...

1231
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:39,957
ls there a problem?

1232
01:37:40,121 --> 01:37:41,191
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

1233
01:37:49,897 --> 01:37:52,138
I'm not gonna launch those ships.

1234
01:37:54,836 --> 01:37:56,144
Captain's orders.

1235
01:37:56,337 --> 01:37:57,577
Move away from your station.

1236
01:37:57,972 --> 01:37:59,007
Like he said...

1237
01:37:59,173 --> 01:38:00,208
Hold it right there.

1238
01:38:00,308 --> 01:38:01,651
Put the gun down!

1239
01:38:01,809 --> 01:38:02,810
Captain's orders.

1240
01:38:05,213 --> 01:38:06,658
You picked the wrong side, Agent.

1241
01:38:08,483 --> 01:38:10,087
Depends on where you're standing.

1242
01:38:54,462 --> 01:38:55,982
Close the bay door!

1243
01:38:56,130 --> 01:38:57,370
Close the bay door now!

1244
01:38:57,865 --> 01:38:58,865
Close the bay door!

1245
01:39:18,653 --> 01:39:19,893
They're initiating launch.

1246
01:39:40,107 --> 01:39:42,678
Hey, Cap, how do we know
the good guys from the bad guys?

1247
01:39:42,910 --> 01:39:44,510
If they're shooting at you, they're bad.

1248
01:40:17,712 --> 01:40:18,713
Hey, Cap,

1249
01:40:18,946 --> 01:40:20,948
I found those bad guys
you were talking about.

1250
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:22,016
You okay?

1251
01:40:24,151 --> 01:40:25,687
I'm not dead yet.

1252
01:40:32,660 --> 01:40:34,401
Let me ask you a question.

1253
01:40:36,898 --> 01:40:40,038
What if Pakistan marched
into Mumbai tomorrow

1254
01:40:41,335 --> 01:40:43,535
and you knew that they were
going to drag your daughters

1255
01:40:43,671 --> 01:40:46,481
into a soccer stadium for execution,

1256
01:40:48,876 --> 01:40:52,221
and you could just stop it,
with a flick of the switch.

1257
01:40:52,413 --> 01:40:53,585
Wouldn't you?

1258
01:40:53,814 --> 01:40:55,418
Wouldn't you all?

1259
01:40:57,318 --> 01:40:58,820
Not if it was your switch.

1260
01:41:23,344 --> 01:41:24,550
I'm sorry.

1261
01:41:30,952 --> 01:41:32,522
Did I step on your moment?

1262
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:36,364
Satellites in range at 3,000 feet.

1263
01:41:37,291 --> 01:41:38,463
Falcon, status?

1264
01:41:38,726 --> 01:41:39,898
Engaging-

1265
01:42:03,985 --> 01:42:05,293
All right, Cap. I'm in.

1266
01:42:07,655 --> 01:42:08,725
Oh, Shit.

1267
01:42:39,253 --> 01:42:40,698
<i>Eight minutes, Cap.</i>

1268
01:42:41,188 --> 01:42:42,599
Working on it.

1269
01:42:50,931 --> 01:42:51,966
What are you doing?

1270
01:42:52,033 --> 01:42:53,637
She's disabling security protocols

1271
01:42:53,701 --> 01:42:55,501
and dumping all the secrets
onto the Internet.

1272
01:42:55,670 --> 01:42:57,310
- Including HYDRA'S.
- And S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.

1273
01:42:58,606 --> 01:42:59,676
If you do this,

1274
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:01,613
none of your past is
gonna remain hidden.

1275
01:43:04,679 --> 01:43:07,182
Are you sure you're ready
for the world to see you

1276
01:43:07,381 --> 01:43:08,951
as you really are?

1277
01:43:09,684 --> 01:43:11,129
Are you?

1278
01:43:27,368 --> 01:43:28,403
Alpha lock.

1279
01:43:30,538 --> 01:43:31,846
Falcon, where are you now'?

1280
01:43:32,006 --> 01:43:33,006
I had to take a detour.

1281
01:44:03,838 --> 01:44:04,839
<i>Whoo!</i>

1282
01:44:05,539 --> 01:44:07,109
Oh, yeah!

1283
01:44:13,114 --> 01:44:14,184
I'm in.

1284
01:44:17,785 --> 01:44:19,628
Bravo lock.

1285
01:44:21,422 --> 01:44:22,730
Two down, one to go.

1286
01:44:25,025 --> 01:44:26,825
All S.H.I.E.L.D. pilots, scramble.

1287
01:44:27,394 --> 01:44:30,034
We're the only air support
Captain Rogers has got.

1288
01:45:12,473 --> 01:45:15,147
Disabling the encryption
is an executive order.

1289
01:45:15,342 --> 01:45:17,015
It takes two Alpha Level members.

1290
01:45:17,244 --> 01:45:19,190
Don't worry. Company's coming.

1291
01:45:42,803 --> 01:45:43,941
Did you get my flowers?

1292
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:48,480
- I'm glad you're here, Nick.
- Really?

1293
01:45:50,277 --> 01:45:52,154
Because I thought you had me killed.

1294
01:45:52,346 --> 01:45:53,825
You know how the game works.

1295
01:45:54,882 --> 01:45:56,623
So why make me head of S.H.I.E.L.D.'?

1296
01:45:56,684 --> 01:45:57,992
Because you were the best,

1297
01:45:58,152 --> 01:45:59,712
and the most ruthless person
I ever met.

1298
01:45:59,954 --> 01:46:02,161
I did what I did to protect people.

1299
01:46:03,057 --> 01:46:05,037
Our enemies are your enemies, Nick.

1300
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:08,304
Disorder. War.

1301
01:46:09,296 --> 01:46:11,640
It's just a matter of time
before a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow,

1302
01:46:11,799 --> 01:46:13,972
or an EMP fries Chicago.

1303
01:46:15,536 --> 01:46:16,981
Diplomacy?

1304
01:46:17,137 --> 01:46:19,481
A holding action, Nick. A band-aid.

1305
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:23,321
And you know where
I learned that. Bogota.

1306
01:46:25,045 --> 01:46:27,753
You didn't ask.
You just did what had to be done.

1307
01:46:28,983 --> 01:46:33,261
I can bring order to the lives
of seven billion people

1308
01:46:33,988 --> 01:46:35,592
by sacrificing 20 million.

1309
01:46:37,157 --> 01:46:39,103
It's the next step, Nick.

1310
01:46:39,326 --> 01:46:40,430
If you have the courage to take it.

1311
01:46:40,661 --> 01:46:42,732
No. I have the courage not to.

1312
01:46:47,234 --> 01:46:49,111
<i>Retinal scanner active.</i>

1313
01:46:50,604 --> 01:46:53,016
You don't think we've wiped
your clearance from the system?

1314
01:46:53,173 --> 01:46:55,119
I know you erased my password.

1315
01:46:55,342 --> 01:46:57,253
Probably deleted my retinal scan.

1316
01:46:57,778 --> 01:47:00,622
But if you want to stay ahead
of me, Mr Secretary,

1317
01:47:04,618 --> 01:47:07,599
you need to keep both eyes open.

1318
01:47:12,026 --> 01:47:13,528
<i>Alpha level confirmed.</i>

1319
01:47:14,028 --> 01:47:15,871
<i>Encryption code accepted.</i>

1320
01:47:16,030 --> 01:47:17,202
<i>Safeguards removed.</i>

1321
01:47:17,564 --> 01:47:20,568
Charlie carrier is
45 degrees off the port bow.

1322
01:47:26,273 --> 01:47:27,377
Six minutes.

1323
01:47:27,541 --> 01:47:29,987
Hey, Sam, gonna need a ride.

1324
01:47:30,878 --> 01:47:32,551
Roger. Let me know when you're ready.

1325
01:47:35,149 --> 01:47:36,389
I just did!

1326
01:47:54,134 --> 01:47:56,080
You know, you're a lot heavier
than you look.

1327
01:47:56,236 --> 01:47:57,340
I had a big breakfast.

1328
01:47:59,974 --> 01:48:01,282
Steve!

1329
01:48:31,772 --> 01:48:33,332
<i>Cap! Cap, come in.
Are you okay?</i>

1330
01:48:33,707 --> 01:48:35,015
Yeah, I'm here.

1331
01:48:35,542 --> 01:48:36,702
I'm still on the helicarrier.

1332
01:48:37,644 --> 01:48:39,282
- Where are you?
- I'm grounded.

1333
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:42,224
The suit's down. Sorry, Cap.

1334
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:44,961
Don't worry. I got it.

1335
01:48:46,954 --> 01:48:48,594
<i>Emergency evacuation alert.</i>

1336
01:48:48,655 --> 01:48:51,636
<i>All personnel, proceed to
designated safety zones.</i>

1337
01:48:53,193 --> 01:48:55,070
All S.H.I.E.L.D.
agents regroup at Rally Point Delta.

1338
01:49:00,801 --> 01:49:02,921
<i>Sir, the Council's been breached.</i>

1339
01:49:03,237 --> 01:49:05,649
<i>- Repeat, Dispatch.
- Black widow's up there.</i>

1340
01:49:05,839 --> 01:49:07,182
Headed up.

1341
01:49:09,376 --> 01:49:10,650
- Falcon?
- Yeah.

1342
01:49:10,744 --> 01:49:11,722
Rumlow's headed for the Council.

1343
01:49:11,812 --> 01:49:12,813
I'm on it.

1344
01:49:24,391 --> 01:49:25,471
People are gonna die, Buck.

1345
01:49:27,561 --> 01:49:29,040
I can't let that happen.

1346
01:49:37,504 --> 01:49:38,847
Please don't make me do this.

1347
01:50:49,076 --> 01:50:50,077
Done.

1348
01:50:51,078 --> 01:50:52,079
And it's trending.

1349
01:50:59,753 --> 01:51:01,633
Unless you want a two-inch
hole in your sternum,

1350
01:51:01,655 --> 01:51:02,759
I'd put that gun down.

1351
01:51:05,459 --> 01:51:07,439
That was armed the moment
you pinned it on.

1352
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:27,281
Ahhh!

1353
01:51:41,228 --> 01:51:42,332
Drop it!

1354
01:51:42,963 --> 01:51:43,964
Drop it!

1355
01:52:04,484 --> 01:52:07,727
I'm on 41, headed toward
the southwest stairwell.

1356
01:52:14,428 --> 01:52:16,032
This is gonna hurt.

1357
01:52:17,331 --> 01:52:20,403
There are no prisoners with HYDRA.
Just order.

1358
01:52:20,601 --> 01:52:22,842
And order only comes through pain.

1359
01:52:24,238 --> 01:52:26,616
- You ready for yours?
- Man, shut the hell up.

1360
01:52:28,408 --> 01:52:29,751
Lieutenant, how much longer?

1361
01:52:29,843 --> 01:52:31,914
<i>65 seconds to satellite link.</i>

1362
01:52:32,012 --> 01:52:35,016
Targeting grid engaged.
Lowering weapons array now.

1363
01:52:39,019 --> 01:52:40,089
One minute.

1364
01:52:59,973 --> 01:53:01,543
30 seconds, Cap.

1365
01:53:03,143 --> 01:53:04,713
Stand by.

1366
01:53:07,381 --> 01:53:08,985
Charlie...

1367
01:53:18,292 --> 01:53:20,573
<i>We've reached 3,000 feet.</i>

1368
01:53:20,594 --> 01:53:21,674
Sat link coming online now.

1369
01:53:24,131 --> 01:53:25,235
Deploy algorithm.

1370
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:28,500
Algorithm deployed.

1371
01:53:29,269 --> 01:53:30,789
We are go to target.

1372
01:53:49,790 --> 01:53:51,167
<i>Target saturation reached.</i>

1373
01:53:51,591 --> 01:53:52,592
All targets assigned.

1374
01:53:52,659 --> 01:53:53,660
Fire when ready.

1375
01:53:56,163 --> 01:53:57,369
Firing in...

1376
01:53:57,531 --> 01:53:58,601
<i>Three,</i>

1377
01:53:58,865 --> 01:53:59,866
two.

1378
01:54:01,101 --> 01:54:02,444
One.

1379
01:54:05,105 --> 01:54:06,140
Charlie lock.

1380
01:54:06,606 --> 01:54:07,607
Where are the targets?

1381
01:54:09,109 --> 01:54:10,110
Where are the targets?

1382
01:54:10,711 --> 01:54:11,951
Okay, Cap, get out of there.

1383
01:54:29,363 --> 01:54:30,364
Fire now.

1384
01:54:31,465 --> 01:54:32,705
- But, Steve...
- Do it!

1385
01:54:33,467 --> 01:54:34,639
<i>Do it now!</i>

1386
01:55:05,165 --> 01:55:06,166
What a waste.

1387
01:55:06,333 --> 01:55:09,542
So, you still on the fence
about Rogers' chances?

1388
01:55:09,736 --> 01:55:12,774
Time to go, Councilwoman. This way.
Come on.

1389
01:55:13,273 --> 01:55:14,775
You're going to fly me out of here.

1390
01:55:15,008 --> 01:55:18,182
You know, there was a time
I would've taken a bullet for you.

1391
01:55:18,378 --> 01:55:19,686
You already did.

1392
01:55:19,846 --> 01:55:21,792
You will again, when it's useful.

1393
01:55:35,128 --> 01:55:36,266
Romanoff.

1394
01:55:37,030 --> 01:55:38,100
Natasha.

1395
01:55:40,133 --> 01:55:41,942
Natasha! Come on!

1396
01:55:46,306 --> 01:55:47,580
Ow.

1397
01:55:48,975 --> 01:55:50,545
Those really do sting.

1398
01:56:23,577 --> 01:56:24,988
Hail HYDRA.

1399
01:57:20,467 --> 01:57:21,912
You're out of your depth, kid.

1400
01:57:25,639 --> 01:57:27,141
Son of a bitch!

1401
01:57:39,252 --> 01:57:41,092
Please tell me you got
that chopper in the air!

1402
01:57:41,655 --> 01:57:43,215
<i>Sam, where are you?</i>

1403
01:57:43,657 --> 01:57:45,500
41st floor! Northwest corner!

1404
01:57:45,692 --> 01:57:47,228
We're on it! Stay where you are!

1405
01:57:47,427 --> 01:57:48,531
Not an option!

1406
01:58:03,343 --> 01:58:05,516
41st floor! 41st!

1407
01:58:05,845 --> 01:58:09,190
It's not like they put the floor numbers
on the outside of the building.

1408
01:58:10,550 --> 01:58:13,053
Hill! Where's Steve?
You got a location on Rogers?

1409
01:58:29,536 --> 01:58:30,606
You know me.

1410
01:58:32,372 --> 01:58:33,715
No, I don't!

1411
01:58:43,216 --> 01:58:44,559
Bucky.

1412
01:58:46,052 --> 01:58:47,497
You've known me your whole life.

1413
01:58:55,061 --> 01:58:58,975
Your name is James Buchanan Barnes.

1414
01:58:59,165 --> 01:59:00,405
Shut up!

1415
01:59:09,109 --> 01:59:10,588
I'm not gonna fight you.

1416
01:59:14,581 --> 01:59:15,924
You're my friend.

1417
01:59:22,922 --> 01:59:24,299
You're my mission.

1418
01:59:26,593 --> 01:59:28,595
You're my mission!

1419
01:59:31,931 --> 01:59:32,932
Then finish it.

1420
01:59:36,436 --> 01:59:38,609
Because I'm with you
to the end of the line.

1421
02:01:50,270 --> 02:01:51,613
On your left.

1422
02:02:42,622 --> 02:02:45,000
<i>Do you solemnly
swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,</i>

1423
02:02:45,191 --> 02:02:46,295
<i>and nothing but the truth?</i>

1424
02:02:46,492 --> 02:02:47,903
I do.

1425
02:02:49,896 --> 02:02:51,637
<i>Why haven't
we yet heard from Captain Rogers?</i>

1426
02:02:54,334 --> 02:02:56,245
I don't know what there is
left for him to say.

1427
02:02:56,469 --> 02:02:58,312
I think the wreck in
the middle of the Potomac

1428
02:02:58,504 --> 02:02:59,824
made his point fairly eloquently.

1429
02:02:59,873 --> 02:03:00,851
Well, he could explain how

1430
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:03,646
this country is expected to maintain
its national security

1431
02:03:03,810 --> 02:03:07,917
now that he and you have laid waste
to our intelligence apparatus.

1432
02:03:08,348 --> 02:03:10,328
HYDRA was selling you lies,
not intelligence.

1433
02:03:10,483 --> 02:03:13,362
Many of which you seemed to have had
a personal hand in telling.

1434
02:03:13,553 --> 02:03:14,827
Agent, you should know

1435
02:03:14,988 --> 02:03:16,661
that there are some on this committee

1436
02:03:16,856 --> 02:03:18,995
who feel, given your service record,

1437
02:03:19,158 --> 02:03:20,899
both for this country and against it,

1438
02:03:21,661 --> 02:03:23,402
that you belong in a penitentiary.

1439
02:03:23,596 --> 02:03:25,576
Not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.

1440
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:29,070
You're not going to put me in a prison.

1441
02:03:30,069 --> 02:03:34,017
You're not going to put any of us
in a prison. You know why?

1442
02:03:35,441 --> 02:03:36,852
Do enlighten us.

1443
02:03:37,110 --> 02:03:38,453
Because you need us.

1444
02:03:39,579 --> 02:03:41,855
<i>Yes, the world is a vulnerable place,</i>

1445
02:03:42,048 --> 02:03:44,221
<i>and yes, we help make it that way.</i>

1446
02:03:44,751 --> 02:03:47,527
<i>But we're also the ones
best qualified to defend it.</i>

1447
02:03:49,188 --> 02:03:51,134
So, if you want to arrest me, arrest me.

1448
02:03:52,191 --> 02:03:53,864
You'll know where to find me.

1449
02:04:29,329 --> 02:04:32,173
So, you've experienced
this sort of thing before.

1450
02:04:32,665 --> 02:04:34,235
You get used to it.

1451
02:04:36,936 --> 02:04:39,109
We've been data mining HYDRA'S files.

1452
02:04:39,305 --> 02:04:41,444
Looks like a lot of rats
didn't go down with the ship.

1453
02:04:43,009 --> 02:04:44,352
I'm headed to Europe tonight.

1454
02:04:45,311 --> 02:04:46,585
Wanted to ask if you'd come.

1455
02:04:47,747 --> 02:04:49,351
There's something I got to do first.

1456
02:04:50,283 --> 02:04:52,820
How about you, Wilson?
Could use a man with your abilities.

1457
02:04:53,853 --> 02:04:55,594
I'm more of a soldier than a spy.

1458
02:04:56,689 --> 02:04:58,464
All right, then.

1459
02:05:03,096 --> 02:05:07,306
Anybody asks for me,
tell them they can find me, right here.

1460
02:05:09,102 --> 02:05:10,672
You should be honoured.
That's about as close as he gets

1461
02:05:10,870 --> 02:05:12,508
to saying thank you.

1462
02:05:13,673 --> 02:05:14,777
Not going with him?

1463
02:05:15,274 --> 02:05:16,514
No.

1464
02:05:16,709 --> 02:05:18,711
- Not staying here.
- Nah.

1465
02:05:19,545 --> 02:05:21,705
I blew all my covers.
I got to go figure out a new one.

1466
02:05:21,948 --> 02:05:22,949
That might take a while.

1467
02:05:23,449 --> 02:05:25,053
I'm counting on it.

1468
02:05:27,286 --> 02:05:28,390
That thing you asked for,

1469
02:05:28,788 --> 02:05:31,064
I called in a few favours from Kiev.

1470
02:05:34,027 --> 02:05:36,803
Will you do me a favour'? Call that nurse.

1471
02:05:37,196 --> 02:05:38,402
She's not a nurse.

1472
02:05:38,631 --> 02:05:40,474
And you're not a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

1473
02:05:41,367 --> 02:05:43,472
- What was her name again?
- Sharon.

1474
02:05:44,203 --> 02:05:45,204
She's nice.

1475
02:05:57,683 --> 02:05:59,424
Be careful, Steve.

1476
02:06:00,253 --> 02:06:02,028
You might not want to
pull on that thread.

1477
02:06:13,566 --> 02:06:15,341
You're going after him.

1478
02:06:15,735 --> 02:06:17,009
You don't have to come with me.

1479
02:06:17,170 --> 02:06:18,240
I know.

1480
02:06:20,206 --> 02:06:21,378
When do we start?

1481
02:08:20,793 --> 02:08:24,400
It's over. Fury has released
everything to the public.

1482
02:08:25,131 --> 02:08:26,474
Everything he knows about.

1483
02:08:27,033 --> 02:08:28,953
Herr Strucker, if they get
word of our work here,

1484
02:08:29,068 --> 02:08:30,877
if they find out we serve HYDRA...

1485
02:08:31,070 --> 02:08:32,811
HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D.

1486
02:08:33,806 --> 02:08:36,650
Two sides of a coin
that's no longer currency.

1487
02:08:40,479 --> 02:08:41,981
What we have

1488
02:08:44,016 --> 02:08:46,656
is worth more than
any of them ever knew.

1489
02:08:49,255 --> 02:08:52,998
We've only scratched
the surface and already,

1490
02:08:55,761 --> 02:08:59,607
there are other facilities doing
HYDRA's good work around the world.

1491
02:09:00,766 --> 02:09:04,213
We'll feed them to Captain America
and his colourful friends,

1492
02:09:04,403 --> 02:09:06,246
and keep them off our scent.

1493
02:09:06,439 --> 02:09:08,715
What about the volunteers?

1494
02:09:08,908 --> 02:09:10,444
The dead will be buried so deep

1495
02:09:10,676 --> 02:09:12,781
their own ghosts won't
be able to find them.

1496
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:16,120
And the survivors?

1497
02:09:18,251 --> 02:09:19,753
The twins.

1498
02:09:23,356 --> 02:09:26,428
Sooner or later, they will meet the twins.

1499
02:09:28,628 --> 02:09:30,574
It's not a world of spies any more.

1500
02:09:30,763 --> 02:09:32,743
Not even a world of heroes.

1501
02:09:33,733 --> 02:09:36,441
This is the age of miracles, Doctor.

1502
02:09:38,304 --> 02:09:40,614
There's nothing more horrifying

1503
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:42,578
than a miracle.
